abstract = {This article provides an overview of current research into the synthesis and properties of gold nanorods. Interest in rod-shaped nanoparticles stems from their unique optical properties, which can be approximated by Mie–Gans theory. We begin by outlining briefly the origin of the shape-dependent optical properties of rods. The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties. Initial results on the optical properties of such nanocomposites are reviewed. This review is concluded with a section devoted to the future perspectives for gold rods as novel materials.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the size-dependent penetration ability of gold nanoparticles and the potential application of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles for intranucleus delivery and therapy. We synthesized gold nanoparticles with diameters of 2, 6, 10, and 16 nm and compared their intracellular distribution in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm (2 and 6 nm) could enter the nucleus, whereas larger ones (10 and 16 nm) were found only in the cytoplasm. We then investigated the possibility of using ultrasmall 2 nm nanoparticles as carriers for nuclear delivery of a triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) that binds to the c-myc promoter. Compared to free TFO, the nanoparticle-conjugated TFO was more effective at reducing c-myc RNA and c-myc protein, which resulted in reduced cell viability. Our result demonstrated that the entry of gold nanoparticles into the cell nucleus is critically dependent on the size of the nanoparticles. We developed a strategy for regulating gene expression, by directly delivering TFOs into the nucleus using ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. More importantly, guidelines were provided to choose appropriate nanocarriers for different biomedical purposes.},

abstract = {The open-source code ADDA is described, which implements the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a method to simulate light scattering by finite 3D objects of arbitrary shape and composition. Besides standard sequential execution, ADDA can run on a multiprocessor distributed-memory system, parallelizing a single DDA calculation. Hence the size parameter of the scatterer is in principle limited only by total available memory and computational speed. ADDA is written in C99 and is highly portable. It provides full control over the scattering geometry (particle morphology and orientation, and incident beam) and allows one to calculate a wide variety of integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities (cross sections, the Mueller matrix, etc.). Moreover, ADDA incorporates a range of state-of-the-art DDA improvements, aimed at increasing the accuracy and computational speed of the method. We discuss both physical and computational aspects of the DDA simulations and provide a practical introduction into performing such simulations with the ADDA code. We also present several simulation results, in particular, for a sphere with size parameter 320 (100-wavelength diameter) and refractive index 1.05.},

Compared to gold nanospheres, we observe an increase of QY by about an order of magnitude for particles with a plasmon resonance {\textgreater}650 nm. The observed trend in QY is further confirmed by controlled reshaping of a single gold nanorod to a spherelike shape. Moreover, we identify two spectral components, one around 500 nm originating from a combination of interband transitions and the transverse plasmon and one coinciding with the longitudinal plasmon band. These components are analyzed by correlating scattering and luminescence spectra of single nanorods and performing polarization sensitive measurements. Our study contributes to the understanding of luminescence from gold nanorods. The enhanced QY we report can benefit applications in biological and soft matter studies.},

abstract = {Gold nanorods (NRs) have received much attention due to their size-dependent surface plasmon-related optical properties. A seed-mediated approach has recently been developed for the synthesis of Au NRs with varying length-to-diameter aspect ratios. With the introduction of silver ions in the growth solution, Au NRs of narrow size distributions can be produced in high yields. Herein we describe an approach for the continuous and selective shortening of Au NRs synthesized by the silver ion-assisted seed-mediated method through oxidation with environmentally benign oxygen at slightly elevated temperatures. UV-visible extinction measurements indicate that the longitudinal surface plasmon band of Au NRs decreases in intensity and blue-shifts as a function of the oxidation time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging shows that the length of Au NRs decreases with oxidation and their diameter stays almost constant, which suggests that oxidation starts at the ends of Au NRs. The size distributions of shortened Au NRs are similar to those of starting NRs. Further oxidation transforms Au NRs into nanospheres, which become smaller in diameter and finally completely disappear. It has been found that the oxidation rate of Au NRs can be controlled by temperature and acid concentration. Furthermore, high-resolution TEM studies reveal that Au NRs synthesized by the silver ion-assisted seed-mediated method are single crystalline and they stay single crystalline during oxidation. It is expected that Au NRs of any aspect ratio with narrow size distributions within the limit of that possessed by starting NRs can be produced by this mild oxidation approach.},

We find a drastic reduction of the plasmon dephasing rate in nanorods as compared to small nanospheres due to a suppression of interband damping. The rods studied here also show very little radiation damping, due to their small volumes. These findings imply large local-field enhancement factors and relatively high light-scattering efficiencies, making metal nanorods extremely interesting for optical applications. Comparison with theory shows that pure dephasing and interface damping give negligible contributions to the total plasmon dephasing rate.},

abstract = {Gold nanorods have received much attention due to their unique optical and electronic properties which are dependent on their shape, size, and aspect ratio. This article covers in detail the synthesis, functionalization, self-assembly, and sensing applications of gold nanorods. The synthesis of three major types of rods is discussed: single-crystalline and pentahedrally-twinned rods, which are synthesized by wet chemistry methods, and polycrystalline rods, which are synthesized by templated deposition. Functionalization of these rods is usually necessary for their applications, but can often be problematic due to their surfactant coating. Thus, general strategies are provided for the covalent and noncovalent functionalization of gold nanorods. The review will then examine the significant progress that has been made in controllable assembly of nanorods into various arrangements. This assembly can have a large effect on measurable properties of rods, making it particularly applicable towards sensing of a variety of analytes. Other types of sensing not dependent on nanorod assembly, such as refractive-index based sensing, are also discussed.},

We find that the ratio of generated infrared to visible emission is much stronger for gold nanostructures than for smooth gold films. While visible emission is well explained by interband transitions of d-band electrons into the conduction band and subsequent radiative recombination, the strong infrared emission cannot be accounted for by the same mechanism. We propose that the infrared emission is generated by intraband transitions mediated by the strongly confined fields near metal nanostruc- tures ?localized surface plasmons?. These fields possess wave numbers that are comparable to the wave numbers of electrons in the metal, and the associated field gradients give rise to higher-order multipolar transitions.We compare photoluminescence spectra for single gold spheres, smooth and rough gold films, and sharp gold tips and demonstrate that the infrared signal is only present for surfaces with nanometer-scale roughness.},

abstract = {Tailoring the longitudinal surface plasmon wavelengths (LSPWs), scattering, and absorption cross sections of gold nanorods has been demonstrated by combining anisotropic shortening and transverse overgrowth and judiciously choosing starting Au nanorods. Shortening yields Au nanorods with decreasing lengths but a fixed diameter, while overgrowth produces nanorods with increasing diameters but a nearly unchanged length. Two series of Au nanorods with LSPWs varying in the same spectral range but distinct extinction coefficients are thus obtained. The systematic changes in the LSPW and extinction for the two series of Au nanorods are found to be in good agreement with those obtained from Gans theory. Dark-field imaging performed on two representative nanorod samples with similar LSPWs shows that the scattering intensities of the overgrown nanorods are much larger than those of the shortened nanorods. The experimental results are found to be in very good agreement with those obtained from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. FDTD calculations further reveal that the scattering-to-extinction ratio increases linearly as a function of the diameter for Au nanorods with a fixed aspect ratio.},

abstract = {This article provides a review of our recent Rayleigh scattering measurements on single metal nanoparticles. Two different systems will be discussed in detail: gold nanorods with lengths between 30 and 80 nm, and widths between 8 and 30 nm; and hollow gold-silver nanocubes (termed nanoboxes or nanocages depending on their exact morphology) with edge lengths between 100 and 160 nm, and wall thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. The goal of this work is to understand how the linewidth of the localized surface plasmon resonance depends on the size, shape, and environment of the nanoparticles. Specifically, the relative contributions from bulk dephasing, electron-surface scattering, and radiation damping (energy loss via coupling to the radiation field) have been determined by examining particles with different dimensions. This separation is possible because the magnitude of the radiation damping effect is proportional to the particle volume, whereas, the electron-surface scattering contribution is inversely proportional to the dimensions. For the nanorods, radiation damping is the dominant effect for thick rods (widths greater than 20 nm), while electron-surface scattering is dominant for thin rods (widths less than 10 nm). Rods with widths in between these limits have narrow resonances-approaching the value determined by the bulk contribution. For nanoboxes and nanocages, both radiation damping and electron-surface scattering are significant at all sizes. This is because these materials have thin walls, but large edge lengths and, therefore, relatively large volumes. The effect of the environment on the localized surface plasmon resonance has also been studied for nanoboxes. Increasing the dielectric constant of the surroundings causes a red-shift and an increase in the linewidth of the plasmon band. The increase in linewidth is attributed to enhanced radiation damping.},

Conversely, oxidation with cyanide ions in the absence of CTAB leads to uniform oxidation over the whole surface. Examples of the spatially directed oxidation are provided using large, irregular spheres, nanocubes, and nanorods. We conclude that the mechanism of oxidation depends on whether the oxidant is attached to CTAB micelles. It is postulated that the CTAB micelles approach the nanoparticles preferentially at the tips, leading to spatially directed oxidation.},

Gold nanorods feature a strong plasmon-enhanced two-photon luminescence, can be easily functionalized, and have been shown to be nontoxic. These properties make gold nanorods very suitable for in vivo two-photon luminescence microscopy. By rapid multifocal scanning, we combine the advantages of 3D molecular tracking methods using wide-field imaging with the advantages of two-photon microscopy. Isolated gold nanorods can be localized with a resolution of 4 nm in the xy-plane and 8 nm in the z-direction. The polarization-dependence of the two-photon luminescence signal can be used to resolve the angular orientation, even when two gold nanorods are separated by less than the diffraction limit. Individual nanorods in live U2OS cells could be followed in 3 dimensions for over 30 min, with a photon noise limited accuracy, and a time resolution of 50 ms in 2D and 500 ms in 3D.},

However, while the number of nanoparticle types and applications continues to increase, studies to characterize their effects after exposure and to address their potential toxicity are few in comparison. In the medical field in particular, nanoparticles are being utilized in diagnostic and therapeutic tools to better understand, detect, and treat human diseases. Exposure to nanoparticles for medical purposes involves intentional contact or administration; therefore, understanding the properties of nanoparticles and their effect on the body is crucial before clinical use can occur. This Review presents a summary of the in vitro cytotoxicity data currently available on three classes of nanoparticles. With each of these nanoparticles, different data has been published about their cytotoxicity due to varying experimental conditions as well as differing nanoparticle physiochemical properties. For nanoparticles to move into the clinical arena, it is important that nanotoxicology research uncovers and understands how these multiple factors influence the toxicity of nanoparticles so that their undesirable properties can be avoided. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH a Co.

For rods of the same width, the yield is found to increase quadratically while the wavelength maximum increases linearly with the length. We assign this emission to the electron and hole interband recombination. The increase in the emission yield results from the enhancement effect of the incoming and outgoing electric fields via coupling to the surface plasmon resonance in the rods.

abstract = {The use of lasers, over the past few decades, has emerged to be highly promising for cancer therapy modalities, most commonly the photothermal therapy method, which employs light absorbing dyes for achieving the photothermal damage of tumors, and the photodynamic therapy, which employs chemical photosensitizers that generate singlet oxygen that is capable of tumor destruction. However, recent advances in the field of nanoscience have seen the emergence of noble metal nanostructures with unique photophysical properties, well suited for applications in cancer phototherapy. Noble metal nanoparticles, on account of the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance, possess strongly enhanced visible and near-infrared light absorption, several orders of magnitude more intense compared to conventional laser phototherapy agents. The use of plasmonic nanoparticles as highly enhanced photoabsorbing agents has thus introduced a much more selective and efficient cancer therapy strategy, viz. plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT). The synthetic tunability of the optothermal properties and the bio-targeting abilities of the plasmonic gold nanostructures make the PPTT method furthermore promising. In this review, we discuss the development of the PPTT method with special emphasis on the recent in vitro and in vivo success using gold nanospheres coupled with visible lasers and gold nanorods and silica-gold nanoshells coupled with near-infrared lasers.},

abstract = {Metal nanoshells are a class of nanoparticles with tunable optical resonances. In this article, an application of this technology to thermal ablative therapy for cancer is described. By tuning the nanoshells to strongly absorb light in the near infrared, where optical transmission through tissue is optimal, a distribution of nanoshells at depth in tissue can be used to deliver a therapeutic dose of heat by using moderately low exposures of extracorporeally applied near-infrared (NIR) light. Human breast carcinoma cells incubated with nanoshells in vitro were found to have undergone photothermally induced morbidity on exposure to NIR light (820 nm, 35 W/cm2), as determined by using a fluorescent viability stain. Cells without nanoshells displayed no loss in viability after the same periods and conditions of NIR illumination. Likewise, in vivo studies under magnetic resonance guidance revealed that exposure to low doses of NIR light (820 nm, 4 W/cm2) in solid tumors treated with metal nanoshells reached average maximum temperatures capable of inducing irreversible tissue damage (DeltaT = 37.4 +/- 6.6 degrees C) within 4-6 min. Controls treated without nanoshells demonstrated significantly lower average temperatures on exposure to NIR light (DeltaT {\textless} 10 degrees C). These findings demonstrated good correlation with histological findings. Tissues heated above the thermal damage threshold displayed coagulation, cell shrinkage, and loss of nuclear staining, which are indicators of irreversible thermal damage. Control tissues appeared undamaged.},

abstract = {Due to strong electric fields at the surface, the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by noble metal nanoparticles are strongly enhanced. These unique properties provide the potential of designing novel optically active reagents for simultaneous molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. It is desirable to use agents that are active in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the radiation spectrum to minimize the light extinction by intrinsic chromophores in native tissue. Gold nanorods with suitable aspect ratios (length divided by width) can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region (650-900 nm). In the present work, we provide an in vitro demonstration of gold nanorods as novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies and incubated in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCat) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). The anti-EGFR anti body-conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malignant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time.},

abstract = {Decay of surface plasmons to hot carriers finds a wide variety of applications in energy conversion, photocatalysis and photodetection. However, a detailed theoretical description of plasmonic hot-carrier generation in real materials has remained incomplete. Here we report predictions for the prompt distributions of excited 'hot' electrons and holes generated by plasmon decay, before inelastic relaxation, using a quantized plasmon model with detailed electronic structure. We find that carrier energy distributions are sensitive to the electronic band structure of the metal: gold and copper produce holes hotter than electrons by 1-2 eV, while silver and aluminium distribute energies more equitably between electrons and holes. Momentum-direction distributions for hot carriers are anisotropic, dominated by the plasmon polarization for aluminium and by the crystal orientation for noble metals. We show that in thin metallic films intraband transitions can alter the carrier distributions, producing hotter electrons in gold, but interband transitions remain dominant.},

@article{Novo2006,
abstract = {The scattering spectra of single gold nanorods with aspect ratios between 2 and 4 have been examined by dark field microscopy. The results show that the longitudinal plasmon resonance (electron oscillation along the long axis of the rod) broadens as the width of the rods decreases from 14 to 8 nm. This is attributed to electron surface scattering. Analysis of the data using = + /, where is the effective path length of the electrons and is the Fermi velocity, allows us to determine a value for the surface scattering parameter of = 0.3. Larger rods with widths of 19 and 30 nm were also examined. These samples also show spectral broadening, which is attributed to radiation damping. The relative strengths of the surface scattering and radiation damping effects are in excellent agreement with recent work on spherical gold nanoparticles by Sonnichsen ., , 2002, , 077402; and by Berciaud ., , 2005, , 515.},

abstract = {The local temperature response inside single living cells upon external chemical and physical stimuli was characterized using quantum dots as nano thermometers. The photoluminescence spectral shifts from endocytosed quantum dots were used to map intracellular heat generation in NIH/3T3 cells following Ca(2+) stress and cold shock. The direct observation of inhomogeneous intracellular temperature progression raises interesting new possibilities, including further innovations in nanomaterials for sensing local responses, as well as the concept of subcellular temperature gradient for signaling and regulation in cells.},

@article{Liu2009b,
abstract = {We investigated the effectiveness of low temperatures in reducing plasmon damping by measuring the homogeneous linewidth of plasmon resonances (similar to 1.5 eV) in nanoscale gold bipyramids at temperatures from 293 to 6 K. The linewidth drops linearly with temperature and approaches a constant value at approximately 50 K. Measurements were performed on monodisperse ensembles as well as on single particles. The 30{\%} decrease in the homogeneous linewidth with decreasing temperature is well accounted for by the reduced electron-phonon scattering. The other relaxation mechanisms-electron-electron scattering, electron-surface scattering, and radiative relaxation-do not change significantly with temperature.},
