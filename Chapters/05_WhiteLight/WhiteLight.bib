abstract = {Enhancing the fluorescence of a weak emitter is important to further extend the reach of single-molecule fluorescence imaging to many unexplored systems. Here we study fluorescence enhancement by isolated gold nanorods and explore the role of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on the observed enhancements. Gold nanorods can be cheaply synthesized in large volumes, yet we find similar fluorescence enhancements as literature reports on lithographically fabricated nanoparticle assemblies. The fluorescence of a weak emitter, crystal violet, can be enhanced more than 1000-fold by a single nanorod with its SPR at 629 nm excited at 633 nm. This strong enhancement results from both an excitation rate enhancement of ∼130 and an effective emission enhancement of ∼9. The fluorescence enhancement, however, decreases sharply when the SPR wavelength moves away from the excitation laser wavelength or when the SPR has only a partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the fluorophore. The reported measurements of fluorescence enhancement by 11 nanorods with varying SPR wavelengths are consistent with numerical simulations.},

The spectra reveal new features which are correlated with interband transitions at selected symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. Calculating luminescence spectra based on simplified models of the band structures of the noble metals and taking into account the Fresnel local-field corrections, we find qualitative agreement with the observed spectra from smooth samples. The agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfactory for rough samples. The influence of surface roughness on the luminescence is largely attributable to local-field enhancement in the rough surface protrusions.},

abstract = {Gold nanorods capped with micelles and having an aspect ratio of 2.0–5.4 are found to fluoresce with a quantum yield which is over a million times that of the metal. For rods of the same width, the yield is found to increase quadratically while the wavelength maximum increases linearly with the length. We assign this emission to the electron and hole interband recombination. The increase in the emission yield results from the enhancement effect of the incoming and outgoing electric fields via coupling to the surface plasmon resonance in the rods. This is similar to the previously proposed fluorescence and the Raman enhancement on noble metal rough surfaces.},

abstract = {Metal nanoshells are a class of nanoparticles with tunable optical resonances. In this article, an application of this technology to thermal ablative therapy for cancer is described. By tuning the nanoshells to strongly absorb light in the near infrared, where optical transmission through tissue is optimal, a distribution of nanoshells at depth in tissue can be used to deliver a therapeutic dose of heat by using moderately low exposures of extracorporeally applied near-infrared (NIR) light. Human breast carcinoma cells incubated with nanoshells in vitro were found to have undergone photothermally induced morbidity on exposure to NIR light (820 nm, 35 W/cm2), as determined by using a fluorescent viability stain. Cells without nanoshells displayed no loss in viability after the same periods and conditions of NIR illumination. Likewise, in vivo studies under magnetic resonance guidance revealed that exposure to low doses of NIR light (820 nm, 4 W/cm2) in solid tumors treated with metal nanoshells reached average maximum temperatures capable of inducing irreversible tissue damage (DeltaT = 37.4 +/- 6.6 degrees C) within 4-6 min. Controls treated without nanoshells demonstrated significantly lower average temperatures on exposure to NIR light (DeltaT {\textless} 10 degrees C). These findings demonstrated good correlation with histological findings. Tissues heated above the thermal damage threshold displayed coagulation, cell shrinkage, and loss of nuclear staining, which are indicators of irreversible thermal damage. Control tissues appeared undamaged.},

@article{Sivapalan2013,
abstract = {Design of nanoparticles for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) within suspensions is more involved than simply maximizing the local field enhancement. The enhancement at the nanoparticle surface and the extinction of both the incident and scattered light during propagation act in concert to determine the observed signal intensity. Here we explore these critical aspects of signal generation and propagation through experiment and theory. We synthesized gold nanorods of six different aspect ratios in order to obtain longitudinal surface plasmon resonances that incrementally spanned 600-800 nm. The Raman reporter molecule methylene blue was trap-coated near the surface of each nanorod sample, generating SERS spectra, which were used to compare Raman signals. The average number of reporter molecules per nanorod was quantified against known standards using electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The magnitude of the observed Raman signal is reported for each aspect ratio along with the attenuation due to extinction in suspension. The highest Raman signal was obtained from the nanorod suspension with a plasmon resonance blue-shifted from the laser excitation wavelength. This finding is in contrast to SERS measurements obtained from molecules dried onto the surface of roughened or patterned metal substrates where the maximum observed signal is near or red-shifted from the laser excitation wavelength. We explain these results as a competition between SERS enhancement and extinction, at the excitation and scattered wavelengths, on propagation through the sample.},

Partially for these reasons, colloidal solutions of metallic (especially silver and gold) nanoparticles have long fascinated scientists because of their very intense colours. The intense red colour of colloidal gold nanoparticles is due to their surface plasmon absorption. This article describes the physical origin of the surface plasmon absorption in gold nanoparticles with emphasis on the Mie and also the Maxwell-Garnett theory and reviews the effects of particle size and shape on the resonance condition.

Aspect-ratio-dependent longitudinal surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) were observed at 2.08 ± 0.19 eV, 1.76 ± 0.12 eV, and 1.53 ± 0.15 eV for the 1.86-AR, 2.91-AR, and 3.90-AR samples, respectively. On the basis of both excitation and emission polarization-resolved two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) measurements, AuNR PL emission proceeded by plasmon-mediated radiative electron?hole recombination. The resonant LSPR mode frequencies of the nanorods were determined from interferometrically detected TPPL signals. For these measurements, the interpulse time delays of a spectrally broad laser pulse (1.48?1.65 eV) were changed systematically with attosecond time resolution, and the TPPL signal amplitude was recorded.

The LSPR frequencies were obtained by Fourier transformation of the time-domain TPPL data and compared to dark-field scattering spectra. The accuracy of the interferometric TPPL measurement for recovering plasmon resonance frequencies was confirmed by polarization-dependent measurements; alignment of the laser electric field parallel to the nanorod major axis was LSPR resonant, whereas projection of the laser pulse into an orthogonal plane was not. Finally, dephasing times (T2) for resonant plasmon modes were extracted from analysis of interferometric TPPL and second harmonic generation data. These results showed that the dephasing time increased from 22 ± 4 to 31 ± 9 fs as the LSPR resonance energy decreased from 1.76 to 1.53 eV, as a result of less efficient plasmon dephasing due to interband scattering for lower energy resonances. These results demonstrate the capability of interferometric nonlinear optical imaging with single-nanostructure sensitivity for determining structure-specific dephasing times, which influence the efficiency of metal nanoparticle light-harvesting applications.

abstract = {The photothermal effect of plasmonic nanostructures has numerous applications, such as cancer therapy, photonic gene circuit, large cargo delivery, and nanostructure-enhanced laser tweezers. The photothermal operation can also induce unwanted physical and biochemical effects, which potentially alter the cell behaviors. However, there is a lack of techniques for characterizing the dynamic cell responses near the site of photothermal operation with high spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, we show that the incorporation of locked nucleic acid probes with gold nanorods allows photothermal manipulation and real-time monitoring of gene expression near the area of irradiation in living cells and animal tissues. The multimodal gold nanorod serves as an endocytic delivery reagent to transport the probes into the cells, a fluorescence quencher and a binding competitor to detect intracellular mRNA, and a plasmonic photothermal transducer to induce cell ablation. We demonstrate the ability of the gold nanorod-locked nucleic acid complex for detecting the spatiotemporal gene expression in viable cells and tissues and inducing photothermal ablation of single cells. Using the gold nanorod-locked nucleic acid complex, we systematically characterize the dynamic cellular heat shock responses near the site of photothermal operation. The gold nanorod-locked nucleic acid complex enables mapping of intracellular gene expressions and analyzes the photothermal effects of nanostructures toward various biomedical applications.},

We measured photoluminescence and scattering spectra from 82 gold nanorods using single-particle spectroscopy. We found that the emission and scattering spectra closely resemble each other independent of the nanorod aspect ratio. We assign the photoluminescence to the radiative decay of the longitudinal surface plasmon generated after fast interconversion from excited electron-hole pairs that were initially created by 532 nm excitation. The emission intensity was converted to the quantum yield and was found to approximately exponentially decrease as the energy difference between the excitation and emission wavelength increased for gold nanorods with plasmon resonances between 600 and 800 nm. We compare this plasmon emission to its molecular analogue, fluorescence.},

abstract = {Decay of surface plasmons to hot carriers finds a wide variety of applications in energy conversion, photocatalysis and photodetection. However, a detailed theoretical description of plasmonic hot-carrier generation in real materials has remained incomplete. Here we report predictions for the prompt distributions of excited 'hot' electrons and holes generated by plasmon decay, before inelastic relaxation, using a quantized plasmon model with detailed electronic structure. We find that carrier energy distributions are sensitive to the electronic band structure of the metal: gold and copper produce holes hotter than electrons by 1-2 eV, while silver and aluminium distribute energies more equitably between electrons and holes. Momentum-direction distributions for hot carriers are anisotropic, dominated by the plasmon polarization for aluminium and by the crystal orientation for noble metals. We show that in thin metallic films intraband transitions can alter the carrier distributions, producing hotter electrons in gold, but interband transitions remain dominant.},

We identify the role of plasmons in photoluminescence as modulating the energy transfer between excited electrons and emitted photons. By comparing photoluminescence spectra with scattering spectra, we observed that the photoluminescence of individual gold nanostructures showed the same dependencies on shape, size, and plasmon coupling as the particle plasmon resonances. Our results provide conclusive evidence that the photoluminescence in gold nanostructures indeed occurs via radiative damping of plasmon resonances driven by excited electrons in the metal itself. Moreover, we provide new insight on the underlying mechanism based on our analysis of a reproducible blue shift of the photoluminescence peak (relative to the scattering peak) and observation of an incomplete depolarization of the photoluminescence.},

abstract = {Measuring RNA synthesis and, when required, the level of inhibition, is crucial towards the development of practical strategies to evaluate silencing efficiency of gene silencing approaches. We developed a direct method to follow RNA synthesis in real time based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with a fluorophore labeled hairpin-DNA, i.e. gold-nanobeacon (Au-nanobeacon). Under hairpin configuration, proximity to gold nanoparticles leads to fluorescence quenching; hybridization to a complementary target restores fluorescence emission due to the Au-nanobeacons' conformational reorganization that causes the fluorophore and the AuNP to part from each other, yielding a quantitative response. With this reporter Au-nanobeacon we were able to measure the rate of in vitro RNA synthesis ({\~{}}10.3 fmol of RNA per minute). Then, we designed a second Au-nanobeacon targeting the promoter sequence (inhibitor) so as to inhibit transcription whilst simultaneously monitor the number of promoters being silenced. Using the two Au-nanobeacons in the same reaction mixture, we are capable of quantitatively assess in real time the synthesis of RNA and the level of inhibition. The biosensor concept can easily be extended and adapted to situations when real-time quantitative assessment of RNA synthesis and determination of the level of inhibition are required. In fact, this biosensor may assist the in vitro evaluation of silencing potential of a given sequence to be later used for in vivo gene silencing.},

abstract = {The biological functions of the cell membrane are influenced by the mobility of its constituents, which are thought to be strongly affected by nanoscale structure and organization. Interactions with the actin cytoskeleton have been proposed as a potential mechanism with the control of mobility imparted through transmembrane "pickets" or GPI-anchored lipid nanodomains. This hypothesis is based on observations of molecular mobility using various methods, although many of these lack the spatiotemporal resolution required to fully capture all the details of the interaction dynamics. In addition, the validity of certain experimental approaches, particularly single-particle tracking, has been questioned due to a number of potential experimental artifacts. Here, we use interferometric scattering microscopy to track molecules labeled with 20-40 nm scattering gold beads with simultaneous {\textless}2 nm spatial and 20 $\mu$s temporal precision to investigate the existence and mechanistic origin of anomalous diffusion in bilayer membranes. We use supported lipid bilayers as a model system and demonstrate that the label does not influence time-dependent diffusion in the small particle limit (≤40 nm). By tracking the motion of the ganglioside lipid GM1 bound to the cholera toxin B subunit for different substrates and lipid tail properties, we show that molecular pinning and interleaflet coupling between lipid tail domains on a nanoscopic scale suffice to induce transient immobilization and thereby anomalous subdiffusion on the millisecond time scale.},

The silencing potential is comparable to that of traditional siRNA but the same nanoconjugates structure is also capable of reversing the effect of an exogenous siRNA. We further demonstrate the Gold-nanobeacons' efficiency at targeting and silencing miR-21, an endogenous miRNA involved in cancer development, which could become a valid nanotheranostics approach. Again, expression of miR-21 was inhibited with concomitant increase of the Au-nanobeacons' fluorescence that can be used to assess the silencing effect.

Interest in rod-shaped nanoparticles stems from their unique optical properties, which can be approximated by Mie–Gans theory. We begin by outlining briefly the origin of the shape-dependent optical properties of rods. The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties. Initial results on the optical properties of such nanocomposites are reviewed. This review is concluded with a section devoted to the future perspectives for gold rods as novel materials.},

Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis revealed that the Pc macrocycle was present on the gold surface and also that the TOAB phase transfer reagent, used during the synthesis, was associated with the nanoparticles. The three-component (photosensitizer/gold/phase transfer reagent) nanoparticles were shown to generate singlet oxygen with enhanced quantum yields as compared to the free Pc. Additionally, the association of the transfer reagent promoted the solubility of the surface-bound hydrophobic sensitizer in polar solventswhichwouldfacilitate their systemic injection. The results suggest that these three-component structures have potential as a useful vehicle for the delivery of photosensitizer agents in photodynamic therapy.},

However, there is a lack of such nanostructures for the mid-visible spectral regions as most available chemically stable nanostructures offer high sensitivity in red to far red spectrum. In this work, we report the assembly of highly sensitive nanoparticle structures using a hydroxylamine mediated core-satellite assembly of 20 nm gold nanoparticle satellites onto 60 nm spherical gold cores. The average number of satellites allows tuning the plasmon resonance wavelength from 543 to 575 nm. The core-satellite nanostructures are stable in pH ranges from 5 to 9 and show about two-fold higher plasmonic sensitivity than similar sized gold nanospheres.},

abstract = {A broad visible and infrared photoluminescence continuum is detected from surface-plasmon-enhanced transitions in gold nanostructures. We find that the ratio of generated infrared to visible emission is much stronger for gold nanostructures than for smooth gold films. While visible emission is well explained by interband transitions of d-band electrons into the conduction band and subsequent radiative recombination, the strong infrared emission cannot be accounted for by the same mechanism. We propose that the infrared emission is generated by intraband transitions mediated by the strongly confined fields near metal nanostruc- tures ?localized surface plasmons?. These fields possess wave numbers that are comparable to the wave numbers of electrons in the metal, and the associated field gradients give rise to higher-order multipolar transitions.We compare photoluminescence spectra for single gold spheres, smooth and rough gold films, and sharp gold tips and demonstrate that the infrared signal is only present for surfaces with nanometer-scale roughness.},

We find that at larger trapping powers (i.e., larger temperatures and stiffer traps) the hybridization rates decrease by more than an order of magnitude. This result is explained by higher temperatures preventing the formation of dimers with lower binding energies. Our results demonstrate that plasmonic heating can be used to fine tune the kinetics of biomolecular binding events.},

Compared to gold nanospheres, we observe an increase of QY by about an order of magnitude for particles with a plasmon resonance {\textgreater}650 nm. The observed trend in QY is further confirmed by controlled reshaping of a single gold nanorod to a spherelike shape. Moreover, we identify two spectral components, one around 500 nm originating from a combination of interband transitions and the transverse plasmon and one coinciding with the longitudinal plasmon band. These components are analyzed by correlating scattering and luminescence spectra of single nanorods and performing polarization sensitive measurements. Our study contributes to the understanding of luminescence from gold nanorods. The enhanced QY we report can benefit applications in biological and soft matter studies.},

Recently, the importance of quantifying temperature has been highlighted, as it correlates with biochemical reaction rates. Several methods for detecting intracellular temperature have recently been established. Here we develop a novel method for sensing temperature in living cells based on the imaging technique of fluorescence of quantum dots. We apply the method to quantify the temperature difference in a human derived neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y. Our results show that temperatures in the cell body and neurites are different and thus suggest that inhomogeneous heat production and dissipation happen in a cell. We estimate that heterogeneous heat dissipation results from the characteristic shape of neuronal cells, which consist of several compartments formed with different surface-volume ratios. Inhomogeneous heat production is attributable to the localization of specific organelles as the heat source.},

abstract = {The use of lasers, over the past few decades, has emerged to be highly promising for cancer therapy modalities, most commonly the photothermal therapy method, which employs light absorbing dyes for achieving the photothermal damage of tumors, and the photodynamic therapy, which employs chemical photosensitizers that generate singlet oxygen that is capable of tumor destruction. However, recent advances in the field of nanoscience have seen the emergence of noble metal nanostructures with unique photophysical properties, well suited for applications in cancer phototherapy. Noble metal nanoparticles, on account of the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance, possess strongly enhanced visible and near-infrared light absorption, several orders of magnitude more intense compared to conventional laser phototherapy agents. The use of plasmonic nanoparticles as highly enhanced photoabsorbing agents has thus introduced a much more selective and efficient cancer therapy strategy, viz. plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT). The synthetic tunability of the optothermal properties and the bio-targeting abilities of the plasmonic gold nanostructures make the PPTT method furthermore promising. In this review, we discuss the development of the PPTT method with special emphasis on the recent in vitro and in vivo success using gold nanospheres coupled with visible lasers and gold nanorods and silica-gold nanoshells coupled with near-infrared lasers.},

abstract = {Within the Rayleigh approximation, we investigate the behavior of an individual ellipsoidal metal nanorod that is optically confined in three dimensions using a single focused laser beam. We focus on the description of the optical torque and optical force acting upon the nanorod placed into a linearly polarized Gaussian beam (scalar description of the electric field) or a strongly focused beam (vector field description). The study comprises the influence of the trapping laser wavelength, the angular aperture of focusing optics, the orientation of the ellipsoidal nanorod, and the aspect ratio of its principal axes. The results reveal a significantly different behavior of the nanorod if the trapping wavelength is longer or shorter than the wavelength corresponding to the longitudinal plasmon resonance mode. Published experimental observations are compared with our theoretical predictions with satisfactory results.},

Larger rods with widths of 19 and 30 nm were also examined. These samples also show spectral broadening, which is attributed to radiation damping.

abstract = {Existing methods for the optical detection of single molecules require the molecules to absorb light to produce fluorescence or direct absorption signals. This limits the range of species that can be detected, because most molecules are purely refractive. Metal nanoparticles or dielectric resonators can be used to detect non-absorbing molecules because local changes in the refractive index produce a resonance shift. However, current approaches only detect single molecules when the resonance shift is amplified by a highly polarizable label or by a localized precipitation reaction on the surface of a nanoparticle. Without such amplification, single-molecule events can only be identified in a statistical way. Here, we report the plasmonic detection of single molecules in real time without the need for labelling or amplification. Our sensor consists of a single gold nanorod coated with biotin receptors, and the binding of single proteins is detected by monitoring the plasmon resonance of the nanorod with a sensitive photothermal assay. The sensitivity of our device is ∼700 times higher than state-of-the-art plasmon sensors and is intrinsically limited by spectral diffusion of the surface plasmon resonance.},

We find a drastic reduction of the plasmon dephasing rate in nanorods as compared to small nanospheres due to a suppression of interband damping. The rods studied here also show very little radiation damping, due to their small volumes. These findings imply large local-field enhancement factors and relatively high light-scattering efficiencies, making metal nanorods extremely interesting for optical applications. Comparison with theory shows that pure dephasing and interface damping give negligible contributions to the total plasmon dephasing rate.},

There currently exist several approaches to control the immobilization of nano-objects but they all involve a cumbersome delivery step and require prior knowledge of the hot spot location. Herein, we present a novel technique in which the enhanced local field in the hot spot is the driving mechanism which triggers the binding of proteins via three-photon absorption. This way, we demonstrate exclusive immobilization of nanoscale amounts of BSA molecules into the nanometer-sized gap of plasmonic dimers. The immobilized proteins can then act as a scaffold to subsequently attach an additional nanoscale object such as a molecule or a nanocrystal. This universal technique is envisioned to benefit a wide range of nano-optical functionalities including biosensing, enhanced spectroscopy like SERS or SEIRA as well as quantum optics.},

abstract = {This article provides a review of our recent Rayleigh scattering measurements on single metal nanoparticles. Two different systems will be discussed in detail: gold nanorods with lengths between 30 and 80 nm, and widths between 8 and 30 nm; and hollow gold-silver nanocubes (termed nanoboxes or nanocages depending on their exact morphology) with edge lengths between 100 and 160 nm, and wall thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. The goal of this work is to understand how the linewidth of the localized surface plasmon resonance depends on the size, shape, and environment of the nanoparticles. Specifically, the relative contributions from bulk dephasing, electron-surface scattering, and radiation damping (energy loss via coupling to the radiation field) have been determined by examining particles with different dimensions. This separation is possible because the magnitude of the radiation damping effect is proportional to the particle volume, whereas, the electron-surface scattering contribution is inversely proportional to the dimensions. For the nanorods, radiation damping is the dominant effect for thick rods (widths greater than 20 nm), while electron-surface scattering is dominant for thin rods (widths less than 10 nm). Rods with widths in between these limits have narrow resonances-approaching the value determined by the bulk contribution. For nanoboxes and nanocages, both radiation damping and electron-surface scattering are significant at all sizes. This is because these materials have thin walls, but large edge lengths and, therefore, relatively large volumes. The effect of the environment on the localized surface plasmon resonance has also been studied for nanoboxes. Increasing the dielectric constant of the surroundings causes a red-shift and an increase in the linewidth of the plasmon band. The increase in linewidth is attributed to enhanced radiation damping.},

Surface plasmon resonance sensors are the most commonly used optical sensors due to their unique ability for real-time monitoring the molecular binding events. However, their sensitivities are insufficient to detect trace amounts of small molecular weight molecules such as cancer biomarkers, hormones, antibiotics, insecticides, and explosive materials which are respectively important for early-stage disease diagnosis, food quality control, environmental monitoring, and homeland security protection. With the rapid development of nanotechnology in the past few years, nanomaterials-enhanced surface plasmon resonance sensors have been developed and used as effective tools to sense hard-to-detect molecules within the concentration range between pmol and amol. In this review article, we reviewed and discussed the latest trend and challenges in engineering and applications of nanomaterials-enhanced surface plasmon resonance sensors (e.g., metallic nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, latex nanoparticles and liposome nanoparticles) for detecting "hard-to-identify" biological and chemical analytes. Such information will be viable in terms of providing a useful platform for designing future ultrasensitive plasmonic nanosensors.},

The resulting spherical crystals display uniform scattering spectra and consistent optical coupling at small separations, even showing Fano-like resonances in small clusters. The high monodispersity of the particles we demonstrate should facilitate the self-assembly of nanoparticle clusters with uniform optical resonances, which could in turn be used to fabricate optical metafluids.
