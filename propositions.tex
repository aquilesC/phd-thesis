\begin{enumerate}

\item Heterogeneity between gold nanorods goes beyond what experimental accuracy
can resolve. This is a major drawback that has to be addressed in the future. \\
\textit{Chapters 2-5 of this thesis} 

\item It is not an \textit{a priori} requirement to fully understand a
phenomenon in order to successfully exploit it.
\\
\textit{Chapter 3 of this thesis} 

\item Gold nanospheres could be better suited for photothermal therapy than gold
nanorods, but almost no information on the required properties has been reported
in literature. \\
\textit{Chapter 4 of this thesis}

\item Proposition 4.

\item Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) can be employed, at best, to
measure hot spot temperature. \\
\textit{Pozzi et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 119, 21116-21124 (2015).}

\item The future of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) may lie in
cleverly designed nanoparticles. \\
\textit{Langguth et al., Opt. Express 22, 15397 (2014).}

\item Thermometry in living cells needs a vary careful data analysis and
interpretation, this may lead to artifacts and false conclusions. \\
\textit{Baffou et al., Nat. Methods 11, 899–901 (2014).}

\item Super localization is more than just fitting bright pixels by a Gaussian,
specially when dealing with new sources of light.\\
\textit{Titus et al., ACS Nano 7, 6258–6267 (2013).}

\item Failed research is much riskier for a PhD and for a PI; risk management
should always be a priority.

\item Across Europe more women than men attain tertiary education. However the
earnings of women on average are $16.2\%$ below those of men. Gender inequality
has to be addressed in a definitive way. \\
\textit{Source: Gender Statistics by Eurostat}

\item The scientific \textit{system} forgets that its employees are people.
