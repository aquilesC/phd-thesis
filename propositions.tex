\begin{enumerate}

\item Seemingly identical nanorods can have unexpectedly different luminescence
properties.
\\
\textit{Chapters 2 and 4 of this thesis} 

\item Even if anti-Stokes luminescence is weaker than Stokes
luminescence, it can have a higher signal-to-background ratio.
\\
\textit{Chapter 3 of this thesis} 

\item Nanoparticles with different geometries can have unexpected properties.
\\
\textit{Chapter 4 and 5 of this thesis}

\item The applications of temperature sensing through anti-Stokes luminescence
are not limited to photothermal therapy.
\\
\textit{Chapter 4 of this thesis}

\item Measuring temperature with surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, only
allows to determine temperature in the hotspot. \\
\textit{Pozzi et al., J. Phys. Chem. C 119, 21116-21124 (2015).}

\item The future of plasmonic enhanced fluorescence correlation spectroscopy may
lie in cleverly designed nanoparticles. \\
\textit{Langguth et al., Opt. Express 22, 15397 (2014).}

\item Thermometry in living cells requires very careful data analysis and
interpretation. Sloppy raw data processing may lead to artifacts and false
conclusions.
\\
\textit{Baffou et al., Nat. Methods 11, 899–901 (2014).}

\item Superlocalization requires more than fitting bright pixels by a
Gaussian.\\
\textit{Titus et al., ACS Nano 7, 6258–6267 (2013).}

\item Gender equality in universities cannot be improved only by changing
university policies. 

\item Failed research is much riskier for a PhD candidate than for someone with
a permanent position.

\item Research and its applications have to reach society.

\item The \textit{publish or perish} behavior is not imposed, it is embraced.
