Gold nanorods are excellent candidates to act as nanoprobes because they arereasonably bright emitters upon excitation with a monochromatic source. We studythe luminescence properties of gold nanorods and show that they are efficientemitters at wavelengths shorter than the excitation wavelength. We show thatthis anti-Stokes emission can be used for imaging under high-backgroundconditions such as stained cells. We also show that the spectrum of theanti-Stokes emission can be used to measure the temperature of the nanoparticlesupon excitation with a laser. This technique will open new and excitingpossibilities in the field of photothermal therapy.
