abstract = {Design of nanoparticles for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) within suspensions is more involved than simply maximizing the local field enhancement. The enhancement at the nanoparticle surface and the extinction of both the incident and scattered light during propagation act in concert to determine the observed signal intensity. Here we explore these critical aspects of signal generation and propagation through experiment and theory. We synthesized gold nanorods of six different aspect ratios in order to obtain longitudinal surface plasmon resonances that incrementally spanned 600-800 nm. The Raman reporter molecule methylene blue was trap-coated near the surface of each nanorod sample, generating SERS spectra, which were used to compare Raman signals. The average number of reporter molecules per nanorod was quantified against known standards using electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The magnitude of the observed Raman signal is reported for each aspect ratio along with the attenuation due to extinction in suspension. The highest Raman signal was obtained from the nanorod suspension with a plasmon resonance blue-shifted from the laser excitation wavelength. This finding is in contrast to SERS measurements obtained from molecules dried onto the surface of roughened or patterned metal substrates where the maximum observed signal is near or red-shifted from the laser excitation wavelength. We explain these results as a competition between SERS enhancement and extinction, at the excitation and scattered wavelengths, on propagation through the sample.},

abstract = {We report a new type of holographic interface, which is able to manipulate the three fundamental properties of light (phase, amplitude, and polarization) over a broad wavelength range. The design strategy relies on replacing the large openings of conventional holograms by arrays of subwavelength apertures, oriented to locally select a particular state of polarization. The resulting optical element can therefore be viewed as the superposition of two independent structures with very different length scales, that is, a hologram with each of its apertures filled with nanoscale openings to only transmit a desired state of polarization. As an implementation, we fabricated a nanostructured holographic plate that can generate radially polarized optical beams from circularly polarized incident light, and we demonstrated that it can operate over a broad range of wavelengths. The ability of a single holographic interface to simultaneously shape the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light can find widespread applications in photonics.},

abstract = {In this Letter, we introduce conical-scanning dark-field imaging in four-dimensional (4D) ultrafast electron microscopy to visualize single-particle dynamics of a polycrystalline ensemble undergoing phase transitions. Specifically, the ultrafast metal-insulator phase transition of vanadium dioxide is induced using laser excitation and followed by taking electron-pulsed, time-resolved images and diffraction patterns. The single-particle selectivity is achieved by identifying the origin of all constituent Bragg spots on Debye-Scherrer rings from the ensemble. Orientation mapping and dynamic scattering simulation of the electron diffraction patterns in the monoclinic and tetragonal phase during the transition confirm the observed behavior of Bragg spots change with time. We found that the threshold temperature for phase recovery increases with increasing particle sizes and we quantified the observation through a theoretical model developed for single-particle phase transitions. The reported methodology of conical scanning, orientation mapping in 4D imaging promises to be powerful for heterogeneous ensemble, as it enables imaging and diffraction at a given time with a full archive of structural information for each particle, for example, size, morphology, and orientation while minimizing radiation damage to the specimen.},

Compared to gold nanospheres, we observe an increase of QY by about an order of magnitude for particles with a plasmon resonance {\textgreater}650 nm. The observed trend in QY is further confirmed by controlled reshaping of a single gold nanorod to a spherelike shape. Moreover, we identify two spectral components, one around 500 nm originating from a combination of interband transitions and the transverse plasmon and one coinciding with the longitudinal plasmon band. These components are analyzed by correlating scattering and luminescence spectra of single nanorods and performing polarization sensitive measurements. Our study contributes to the understanding of luminescence from gold nanorods. The enhanced QY we report can benefit applications in biological and soft matter studies.},

Here, we have systematically studied the photothermal reshaping behavior of gold nanorods irradiated with femtosecond laser pulses to report that the instability is driven by curvature-induced surface diffusion rather than a threshold melting process, and that the stability dramatically decreases with increasing aspect ratio. We successfully utilized the surface diffusion model to explain the observations and found that the activation energy for surface diffusion was dependent on the aspect ratio of the rods, from 0.6 eV for aspect ratio of 5 to 1.5 eV for aspect ratio less than 3. This result indicates that the surface atoms are much easier to diffuse around in larger aspect ratio rods than in shorter rods and can induce reshaping at any given temperature. Current plasmo...},

The paper is also intended to be an introductory guideline to those who would like to get involved in FRAP related experimental techniques. Therefore, comprehensive details on different setups and data analysis are given, as well as a brief outline of the problems that may be encountered when performing FRAP. Overall, this review shows the great potential of FRAP in pharmaceutical research. This is complemented by our own results illustrating the possibility of performing FRAP in microscopic dosage forms (microspheres) using a high resolution variant of FRAP.},

abstract = {Drug delivery systems (DDSs) offer efficient and localized drug transportation as well as reduce associated side effects. In order to better understand DDSs, precise observation of drug release and delivery is required. Here, we present a strategy, plasmonic-tunable Raman/fluorescence imaging spectroscopy, to track the release and delivery of an anticancer drug (doxorubicin) from gold nanoparticle carriers in real time at a single living cell level. A pH-responsive drug release profile was attained through the conjugation of doxorubicin (DOX) to the nanoparticle surface via a pH-sensitive hydrazone linkage. When DOX is bound to the surface of the gold nanoparticle, its surface-enhanced Raman spectrum can be seen, but its fluorescence is quenched. When released, due to the lysosomes' acidic pH, its Raman enhancement is greatly reduced, changing the acquired Raman spectrum and in turn allowing for the visualization of its fluorescence signal. The plasmonic-tunable Raman/fluorescence properties enabled the tracking of the DOX release and delivery process from the gold nanoparticle surface to the lysosomes of single living cells under the acidic pH change of their microenvironments. This technique offers great potential to follow the molecular mechanisms of drug delivery and release in living cells, as well as the cellular response to drug action.},

Quantitatively characterizing the resulting local temperature increase can be very challenging in isolated nanostructures. By measuring the optically induced change in resistance of metal nanowires with a transverse plasmon mode, we quantitatively determine the temperature increase in single nanostructures with the dependence on incident polarization clearly revealing the plasmonic heating mechanism. Computational modeling explains the resonant and nonresonant contributions to the optical heating and the dominant pathways for thermal transport. These results, obtained by combining electronic and optical measurements, place a bound on the role of optical heating in prior experiments and suggest design guidelines for engineered structures meant to leverage such effects.},

abstract = {Multiplexed optical recording provides an unparalleled approach to increasing the information density beyond 10(12) bits per cm(3) (1 Tbit cm(-3)) by storing multiple, individually addressable patterns within the same recording volume. Although wavelength, polarization and spatial dimensions have all been exploited for multiplexing, these approaches have never been integrated into a single technique that could ultimately increase the information capacity by orders of magnitude. The major hurdle is the lack of a suitable recording medium that is extremely selective in the domains of wavelength and polarization and in the three spatial domains, so as to provide orthogonality in all five dimensions. Here we show true five-dimensional optical recording by exploiting the unique properties of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of gold nanorods. The longitudinal SPR exhibits an excellent wavelength and polarization sensitivity, whereas the distinct energy threshold required for the photothermal recording mechanism provides the axial selectivity. The recordings were detected using longitudinal SPR-mediated two-photon luminescence, which we demonstrate to possess an enhanced wavelength and angular selectivity compared to conventional linear detection mechanisms. Combined with the high cross-section of two-photon luminescence, this enabled non-destructive, crosstalk-free readout. This technique can be immediately applied to optical patterning, encryption and data storage, where higher data densities are pursued.},

Cells spontaneously organize on a surface into a visually striking two-dimensional hexagonal lattice of rotating cells. As each constituent cell rotates its flagella, it creates a tornadolike flow that pulls neighboring cells towards and around it. As cells rotate against their neighbors, they exert forces on one another, causing the crystal to rotate and cells to reorganize. We show how these dynamics arise from hydrodynamic and steric interactions between cells. We derive the equations of motion for a crystal, show that this model explains several aspects of the observed dynamics, and discuss the stability of these active crystals.},

abstract = {Understanding the nanoscale heating-induced local thermal response is important but hampered by lack of information on temperatures at such small scales. This paper reports laser-induced heating and thermal equilibration of metal nanoparticles supported on different substrates and immersed in several media. We use single-particle spectroscopy to monitor nanoparticle temperature rises due to laser excitation. Because of changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium, the scattering spectrum of the gold nanoparticles undergoes a shift that is related to the temperature of the system. We find that the temperature increase depends on both the surrounding medium and the supporting substrate. We furthermore model the nanoparticle temperature using a simplified 1-D heat conduction model with an effective thermal conductivity that takes both substrate and environment into account. The results from this model are also compared to a more detailed 2-D heat transfer analysis. The results presented here are quite new and important to many plasmonic nanoparticle applications where the strong absorption cross section of the nanoparticles leads to a significant temperature rise. In particular, the current work introduces an analysis that can be easily implemented to model the temperature of a nanoparticle supported on a substrate, as is the case in many single-particle measurements.},

abstract = {Collections of interacting, self-propelled particles have been extensively studied as minimal models of many living and synthetic systems from bird flocks to active colloids. However, the influence of active rotations in the absence of self-propulsion (i.e. spinning without walking) remains less explored. Here, we numerically and theoretically investigate the behaviour of ensembles of self-spinning dimers. We find that geometric frustration of dimer rotation by interactions yields spatiotemporal order and active melting with no equilibrium counterparts. At low density, the spinning dimers self-assemble into a triangular lattice with their orientations phase-locked into spatially periodic phases. The phase-locked patterns form dynamical analogues of the ground states of various spin models, transitioning from the 3-state Potts antiferromagnet at low densities to the striped herringbone phase of planar quadrupoles at higher densities. As the density is raised further, the competition between active rotations and interactions leads to melting of the active spinner crystal. Emergent edge currents arise as a non-equilibrium signature of the transition to the active spinner liquid and vanish when the system eventually undergoes kinetic arrest at very high densities. Our findings may be realized in systems ranging from liquid crystal and colloidal experiments to tabletop realizations using macroscopic chiral grains.},

We present ab initio predictions of the electron-temperature dependent heat capacities and electron-phonon coupling coefficients of plasmonic metals. We find substantial differences from free-electron and semi-empirical estimates, especially in noble metals above transient electron temperatures of 2000 K, because of the previously-neglected strong dependence of electron-phonon matrix elements on electron energy. We also present first-principles calculations of the electron-temperature dependent dielectric response of hot electrons in plasmonic metals, including direct interband and phonon-assisted intraband transitions, facilitating complete theoretical predictions of the time-resolved optical probe signatures in ultrafast laser experiments.},

Multiple mechanisms of thermogeneration have been proposed, localized in different subcellular organelles. However, visualizing thermogenesis directly in intact organelles has been challenging. Here we have developed genetically encoded, GFP-based thermosensors (tsGFPs) that enable visualization of thermogenesis in discrete organelles in living cells. In tsGFPs, a tandem formation of coiled-coil structures of the Salmonella thermosensing protein TlpA transmits conformational changes to GFP to convert temperature changes into visible and quantifiable fluorescence changes. Specific targeting of tsGFPs enables visualization of thermogenesis in the mitochondria of brown adipocytes and the endoplasmic reticulum of myotubes. In HeLa cells, tsGFP targeted to mitochondria reveals heterogeneity in thermogenesis that correlates with the electrochemical gradient. Thus, tsGFPs are powerful tools to noninvasively assess thermogenesis in living cells.},

abstract = {Infrared vibrations of molecular species can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude with plasmonic nanoantennas. Based on the confined electromagnetic near-fields of resonantly excited metal nanoparticles, this antenna-assisted surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy enables the detection of minute amounts of analytes localized in the nanometer-scale vicinity of the structure. Among other important parameters, the distance of the vibrational oscillator of the analyte to the nanoantenna surface determines the signal enhancement. For sensing applications, this is a particularly important issue since the vibrating dipoles of interest may be located far away from the antenna surface because of functional layers and the large size of biomolecules, proteins, or bacteria. The relation between distance and signal enhancement is thus of paramount importance and measured here with in situ infrared spectroscopy during the growth of a probe layer. Our results indicate a diminishing signal enhancement and the effective saturation of the plasmonic resonance shift beyond 100 nm. The experiments carried out under ultra-high-vacuum conditions are supported by numerical calculations.},

abstract = {In this work, we report the multifunctional character of neodymium-doped LaF3 core/shell nanoparticles. Because of the spectral overlap of the neodymium emission bands with the transparency windows of human tissues, these nanoparticles emerge as relevant subtissue optical probes. For neodymium contents optimizing the luminescence brightness of Nd3+:LaF3 nanoparticles, subtissue penetration depths of several millimeters have been demonstrated. At the same time, it has been found that the infrared emission bands of Nd3+:LaF3 nanoparticles show a remarkable thermal sensitivity, so that they can be advantageously used as luminescent nanothermometers for subtissue thermal sensing. This possibility has been demonstrated in this work: Nd3+:LaF3 nanoparticles have been used to provide optical control over subtissue temperature in a single-beam plasmonic-mediated heating experiment. In this experiment, gold nanorods are used as nanoheaters while thermal reading is performed by the Nd3+:LaF3 nanoparticles. The possibility of a real single-beam-controlled subtissue hyperthermia process is, therefore, pointed out.},

abstract = {Measuring RNA synthesis and, when required, the level of inhibition, is crucial towards the development of practical strategies to evaluate silencing efficiency of gene silencing approaches. We developed a direct method to follow RNA synthesis in real time based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with a fluorophore labeled hairpin-DNA, i.e. gold-nanobeacon (Au-nanobeacon). Under hairpin configuration, proximity to gold nanoparticles leads to fluorescence quenching; hybridization to a complementary target restores fluorescence emission due to the Au-nanobeacons' conformational reorganization that causes the fluorophore and the AuNP to part from each other, yielding a quantitative response. With this reporter Au-nanobeacon we were able to measure the rate of in vitro RNA synthesis ({\~{}}10.3 fmol of RNA per minute). Then, we designed a second Au-nanobeacon targeting the promoter sequence (inhibitor) so as to inhibit transcription whilst simultaneously monitor the number of promoters being silenced. Using the two Au-nanobeacons in the same reaction mixture, we are capable of quantitatively assess in real time the synthesis of RNA and the level of inhibition. The biosensor concept can easily be extended and adapted to situations when real-time quantitative assessment of RNA synthesis and determination of the level of inhibition are required. In fact, this biosensor may assist the in vitro evaluation of silencing potential of a given sequence to be later used for in vivo gene silencing.},

We find that at larger trapping powers (i.e., larger temperatures and stiffer traps) the hybridization rates decrease by more than an order of magnitude. This result is explained by higher temperatures preventing the formation of dimers with lower binding energies. Our results demonstrate that plasmonic heating can be used to fine tune the kinetics of biomolecular binding events.},

The unique crystal facets of the starting nanorods results in anisotropic crystal overgrowth. The overgrowth rates along different crystallographical directions can be further regulated by adding foreign ions or by using different metal reduction methods. This overgrowth study provides insights on how different metal ions could be reduced preferentially on different Au nanorod surfaces, so that the composition, aspect ratio, shape, and facet of the resulting nanostructures can be rationally tuned. These surfactant-stabilized bimetallic Au(core)M(shell) (M=Au, Ag, Pd) nanorod colloids might serve as better substrates in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy as well as exhibiting enhanced catalytic properties.},

In this article, we propose a new measurement method based on the control of the nonlinear optical response of plasmonic nanostructures by means of Fano resonances. It is shown that Fano resonances resulting from the coupling between a bright mode and a dark mode at the fundamental wavelength enable unprecedented and direct manipulation of the nonlinear electromagnetic sources at the nanoscale. In the case of second harmonic generation from gold nanodolmens, the different nonlinear sources distributions induced by the different coupling regimes are clearly revealed in the far-field distribution. Hence, the configuration of the nanostructure can be accurately determined in 3-dimensions by recording the wave scattered at the second harmonic wavelength. Indeed, the conformation of the different elements building the system is encoded in the nonlinear far-field distribution, making second harmonic generation a promising tool for reading 3-dimension plasmonic nanorulers. Furthemore, it is shown that 3-dimension plasmonic nanorulers can be implemented with simpler geometries than in the linear regime while providing complete information on the structure conformation, including the top nanobar position and orientation.},

abstract = {Acoustic vibrations of single gold nanorods coated with silver were investigated. We used single-particle pump-probe spectroscopy to monitor the silver deposition through the particle vibrations. Two vibration modes, the breathing mode and extensional mode, are observed, and the vibrational frequencies are measured as functions of the amount of silver deposited on single gold nanorods. The breathing mode frequency was found to decrease with silver deposition, while the extensional mode frequency was almost constant for silver shells up to 6 nm. The frequency changes agree with a model based on continuum mechanics and on the assumption of a uniform silver coating. The quality factors for the breathing mode and the extensional mode are hardly affected by silver deposition, indicating that the introduced interface between gold and silver contributes negligibly to the damping of the particle vibrations. Finally, we demonstrated that an atomic layer of silver can be detected using the particle acoustic vibrations.},

abstract = {We theoretically study the spectrum of radial vibrational modes in composite metal nanostructures such as bimetallic core-shell particles and metal nanoshells with dielectric core in an environment. We calculate frequencies and damping rates of fundamental (breathing) modes for these nanostructures along with those of two higher-order modes. For metal nanoshells, we find that the breathing mode frequency is always lower than the one for solid particles of the same size, while the damping is higher and increases with a reduction in the shell thickness. We identify two regimes that can be characterized as weakly damped and overdamped vibrations in the presence of external medium. For bimetallic particles, we find periodic dependence of frequency and damping rate on the shell thickness with period being determined by the mode number. For both types of nanostructures, the frequency of higher modes is nearly independent of the environment, while the damping rate shows a strong sensitivity to the outside medium.},

The implementation employs the heat released by an optically excited plasmonic metal nanoparticle to control the size of an isotropic bubble in a nematic liquid crystal film. The nematic film is designed as a zero-order half-wave plate that rotates an incident probe light polarization by $\pi$/2 and is blocked by an analyzing polarizer behind the structure. The growing isotropic bubble disturbs the half-wave plate and causes the probe to be transmitted through the modulator structure. Our results demonstrate that dissipative processes may be advantageously used to control light by light.},

We present here a method for tracking individual 5-nm gold nanoparticles on live cells. It relies on the photothermal effect and the detection of the Laser Induced Scattering around a NanoAbsorber (LISNA). The key point for recording trajectories at video rate is the use of a triangulation procedure. The effectiveness of the method is tested against single fluorescent molecule tracking in live COS7 cells on subsecond timescales. We further demonstrate recordings for several minutes of AMPA receptors trajectories on the plasma membrane of live neurons. Single Nanoparticle Photothermal Tracking has the unique potential to record arbitrary long trajectory of membrane proteins using nonfluorescent nanometer-sized labels.},

Over the past five decades, limited glimpses into the relationship between gene sequence and function have sparked a long debate regarding the distribution, relative proportion, and evolutionary significance of deleterious, neutral, and advantageous mutations. Our systematic experimental measurement of fitness effects of Hsp90 mutants in yeast, evaluated in the light of existing population genetic theory, are remarkably consistent with a nearly neutral model of molecular evolution.},

abstract = {We developed two simple, rapid, and cost-effective fluorescent nanosensors, both featuring bovine serum albumin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC))-capped gold nanoparticles (FITC-BSA-Au NPs), for the selective sensing of cyanide (CN(-)) and iodine (I(-)) ions in high-salinity solutions and edible salt samples. During the preparation of FITC-BSA-Au NP probes, when AuNPs were introduced to the mixture containing FITC and BSA, the unconjugated FITC and FITC-labeled BSA (FITC-BSA) adsorbed to the particles' surfaces. These probes operated on a basic principle that I(-) and CN(-) deposited on the surfaces of the Au NPs or the etching of Au NPs induced the release of FITC molecules or FITC-BSA into the solution, and thus restored the florescence of FITC. We employed FITC-BSA to protect the Au NPs from significant aggregation in high-salinity solutions. In the presence of masking agents such as S(2)O(8)(2-)/Pb(2+), FITC-BSA-Au NPs facilitated the selective detection of CN(-) (by at least 150-fold in comparison with other anions). We also demonstrated that the FITC-BSA-Au NPs in the presence of H(2)O(2) could selectively detect I(-) down to 50 nM. Taking advantages of their high stability and selectivity, we employed our FITC-BSA-Au NP-based probes for the detection of CN(-) and I(-) in water samples (pond water, tap water, and seawater) and detection of I(-) in edible salt samples, respectively. This simple, rapid, and cost-effective sensing system appears to demonstrate immense practical potential for the detection of anions in real samples.},

At the highest temperature examined (250 °C) the nanorods are transformed into spheres within an hour. On the other hand, no structural changes are observed in the laser-induced heating experiments up to temperatures of 700 ± 50 °C. This is attributed to thermal diffusion in the laser experiments. Measurements of the period of the extensional mode of the nanorods using time-resolved spectroscopy show a significant softening at high pump laser powers. However, the decrease in the period is less than expected from bulk Young's modulus vs. temperature data.},

abstract = {Metal nanoshells are a class of nanoparticles with tunable optical resonances. In this article, an application of this technology to thermal ablative therapy for cancer is described. By tuning the nanoshells to strongly absorb light in the near infrared, where optical transmission through tissue is optimal, a distribution of nanoshells at depth in tissue can be used to deliver a therapeutic dose of heat by using moderately low exposures of extracorporeally applied near-infrared (NIR) light. Human breast carcinoma cells incubated with nanoshells in vitro were found to have undergone photothermally induced morbidity on exposure to NIR light (820 nm, 35 W/cm2), as determined by using a fluorescent viability stain. Cells without nanoshells displayed no loss in viability after the same periods and conditions of NIR illumination. Likewise, in vivo studies under magnetic resonance guidance revealed that exposure to low doses of NIR light (820 nm, 4 W/cm2) in solid tumors treated with metal nanoshells reached average maximum temperatures capable of inducing irreversible tissue damage (DeltaT = 37.4 +/- 6.6 degrees C) within 4-6 min. Controls treated without nanoshells demonstrated significantly lower average temperatures on exposure to NIR light (DeltaT {\textless} 10 degrees C). These findings demonstrated good correlation with histological findings. Tissues heated above the thermal damage threshold displayed coagulation, cell shrinkage, and loss of nuclear staining, which are indicators of irreversible thermal damage. Control tissues appeared undamaged.},

The results show that introduction of shape anisotropy, i.e., evolution from a nanosphere to a nanorod, modifies the periods of the fundamental radial and quadrupolar modes and leads to activation of a quadrupolar-like mode in time-domain studies. In contrast, crystallinity is shown to have a negligible impact on the breathing mode frequency of a nanosphere formed by a cubic crystal and does not activate any quadrupolar mode. The effect of an anisotropic excitation in time-resolved measurements of a large nanosphere is also discussed.},

For rods of the same width, the yield is found to increase quadratically while the wavelength maximum increases linearly with the length. We assign this emission to the electron and hole interband recombination. The increase in the emission yield results from the enhancement effect of the incoming and outgoing electric fields via coupling to the surface plasmon resonance in the rods. This is similar to the previously proposed fluorescence and the Raman enhancement on noble metal rough surfaces.},

We find a drastic reduction of the plasmon dephasing rate in nanorods as compared to small nanospheres due to a suppression of interband damping. The rods studied here also show very little radiation damping, due to their small volumes. These findings imply large local-field enhancement factors and relatively high light-scattering efficiencies, making metal nanorods extremely interesting for optical applications. Comparison with theory shows that pure dephasing and interface damping give negligible contributions to the total plasmon dephasing rate.},

abstract = {We performed polarized fluorescence emission studies of Nile Red (NR) in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA), and poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) at the single molecule (SM) and at the ensemble level to study the in cage movements of the ground-state molecule in polymer films of nanometric thickness at room temperature. Experiments were performed with wide field irradiation. At the ensemble level, the linearly polarized irradiation was used to induce a photoselection by bleaching, which is compensated by rotational diffusion. Both results show an appreciable difference in mobility of NR in the films that is correlated with the different glass-transition temperatures of the films, particularly in PEMA, which displays a clearly distinct behavior between the 200 nm films, representing a rigid environment, and the 25 nm ones, showing much higher mobility. We developed a model of broad application for polarized photobleaching that allows obtaining rotational diffusion coefficients and photobleaching quantum yields in an easy way from ensemble experiments. The parameters obtained from ensemble measurements correlate well with the results from SM experiments.},

@article{Tsung2006,
abstract = {Gold nanorods (NRs) have received much attention due to their size-dependent surface plasmon-related optical properties. A seed-mediated approach has recently been developed for the synthesis of Au NRs with varying length-to-diameter aspect ratios. With the introduction of silver ions in the growth solution, Au NRs of narrow size distributions can be produced in high yields. Herein we describe an approach for the continuous and selective shortening of Au NRs synthesized by the silver ion-assisted seed-mediated method through oxidation with environmentally benign oxygen at slightly elevated temperatures. UV-visible extinction measurements indicate that the longitudinal surface plasmon band of Au NRs decreases in intensity and blue-shifts as a function of the oxidation time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging shows that the length of Au NRs decreases with oxidation and their diameter stays almost constant, which suggests that oxidation starts at the ends of Au NRs. The size distributions of shortened Au NRs are similar to those of starting NRs. Further oxidation transforms Au NRs into nanospheres, which become smaller in diameter and finally completely disappear. It has been found that the oxidation rate of Au NRs can be controlled by temperature and acid concentration. Furthermore, high-resolution TEM studies reveal that Au NRs synthesized by the silver ion-assisted seed-mediated method are single crystalline and they stay single crystalline during oxidation. It is expected that Au NRs of any aspect ratio with narrow size distributions within the limit of that possessed by starting NRs can be produced by this mild oxidation approach.},

Here, we demonstrate that the cellular uptake of peptide-targeted liposomes and micelles can be significantly enhanced by increasing the hydrophilicity of the targeting peptide sequence while simultaneously optimizing the EG peptide-linker length. Two distinct disease models were analyzed, as the nanoparticles were functionalized with either VLA-4 or HER2 antagonistic peptides to target multiple myeloma or breast cancer cells, respectively. Our results demonstrated that including a short oligolysine chain adjacent to the targeting peptide sequence effectively increased cellular uptake of targeted nanoparticles up to ∼80-fold using an EG6 peptide-linker in liposomes and ∼27-fold using an EG18 peptide-linker in micelles for the VLA-4/multiple myeloma system. Similar trends were also observed in the HER2/breast cancer system with the EG18 peptide-linker resulting in optimal uptake for both types of nanoparticles. Cellular uptake efficiency of these formulations was also confirmed under fluidic conditions mimicking physiological systems. Taken together, these results demonstrated the significance of using the right design elements to improve the cellular uptake of nanoparticles.},

Additionally, fluorescence microscopy is in a state of rapid evolution, with new techniques, probes and equipment appearing almost daily. Familiarity with fluorescence is a prerequisite for taking advantage of many of these developments. This review attempts to provide a framework for understanding excitation of and emission by fluorophores, the way fluorescence microscopes work, and some of the ways fluorescence can be optimized.},

abstract = {We probe the rotational diffusion of a perylene dye in supercooled glycerol, 5-25 K above the glass-transition temperature (T(g) = 190 K) at the ensemble and the single-molecule level. The single-molecule results point to a broad distribution of local viscosities that vary by a factor of five or more for different individual fluorophores at a given temperature. By following the same single molecules at various temperatures, we find that the distribution of local viscosities itself broadens upon approaching T(g). This spatial heterogeneity is found to relax extremely slowly, persisting over hours or even days. These results convey a picture of heterogeneous liquid pockets separated by solid-like walls, which exist already well above the viscosimetric glass transition.},

@article{Flamholz2013,
abstract = {Contrary to the textbook portrayal of glycolysis as a single pathway conserved across all domains of life, not all sugar-consuming organisms use the canonical Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnass (EMP) glycolytic pathway. Prokaryotic glucose metabolism is particularly diverse, including several alternative glycolytic pathways, the most common of which is the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway. The prevalence of the ED pathway is puzzling as it produces only one ATP per glucose-half as much as the EMP pathway. We argue that the diversity of prokaryotic glucose metabolism may reflect a tradeoff between a pathway's energy (ATP) yield and the amount of enzymatic protein required to catalyze pathway flux. We introduce methods for analyzing pathways in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics and show that the ED pathway is expected to require several-fold less enzymatic protein to achieve the same glucose conversion rate as the EMP pathway. Through genomic analysis, we further show that prokaryotes use different glycolytic pathways depending on their energy supply. Specifically, energy-deprived anaerobes overwhelmingly rely upon the higher ATP yield of the EMP pathway, whereas the ED pathway is common among facultative anaerobes and even more common among aerobes. In addition to demonstrating how protein costs can explain the use of alternative metabolic strategies, this study illustrates a direct connection between an organism's environment and the thermodynamic and biochemical properties of the metabolic pathways it employs.},

Force sensing based on direct measurement of light momentum changes stands out among these as an exception. Especially significant is this method's potential for working within living cells, with non-spherical particles or with non-Gaussian beams. However, so far, the technique has only been implemented in counter-propagating dual-beam traps, which are difficult to align and integrate with other microscopy techniques. Here, we show the feasibility of a single-beam gradient-trap system working with a force detection technique based on this same principle.},

An interferometric photothermal optical lock-in approach (POLI) is shown to improve SNR for detecting nanoparticles (NPs) on multiple substrates, including a monolayer of NPs on a silanized coverslip, and NPs bound to live cells. Furthermore, the set up allowed for co-registered quantitative phase imaging (QPI) to be acquired in an off-axis holographic set-up. An SNR of 103 was obtained for NP-tagging of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in live cells with a 3 second acquisition, while an SNR of 47 was seen for 20 ms acquisition. An analysis of improvements in SNR due to averaging multiple frames is presented, which suggest that residual photothermal signal can be a limiting factor. The combination of techniques allows for high resolution imaging of cell structure via QPI with the ability to identify receptor expression via POLI.},

Surface plasmon resonance sensors are the most commonly used optical sensors due to their unique ability for real-time monitoring the molecular binding events. However, their sensitivities are insufficient to detect trace amounts of small molecular weight molecules such as cancer biomarkers, hormones, antibiotics, insecticides, and explosive materials which are respectively important for early-stage disease diagnosis, food quality control, environmental monitoring, and homeland security protection. With the rapid development of nanotechnology in the past few years, nanomaterials-enhanced surface plasmon resonance sensors have been developed and used as effective tools to sense hard-to-detect molecules within the concentration range between pmol and amol. In this review article, we reviewed and discussed the latest trend and challenges in engineering and applications of nanomaterials-enhanced surface plasmon resonance sensors (e.g., metallic nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, latex nanoparticles and liposome nanoparticles) for detecting "hard-to-identify" biological and chemical analytes. Such information will be viable in terms of providing a useful platform for designing future ultrasensitive plasmonic nanosensors.},

Electrical detection, however, poses a challenge, as each nanopore circuit must be electrically independent, which requires complex nanofluidics and embedded electrodes. Here, we present an optical method for simultaneous measurements of the ionic current across an array of solid-state nanopores, requiring no additional fabrication steps. Proof-of-principle experiments are conducted that show simultaneous optical detection and characterization of ssDNA and dsDNA using an array of pores.

abstract = {We present an axisymmetric computational model to study the heating processes of gold nanoparticles, specifically nanorods, in aqueous medium by femtosecond laser pulses. We use a two-temperature model for the particle, a heat diffusion equation for the surrounding water to describe the heat transfer processes occurring in the system, and a thermal interface conductance to describe the coupling efficiency at the particle/water interface. We investigate the characteristic time scales of various fundamental processes, including lattice heating and thermal equilibration at the particle/surroundings interface, the effects of multiple laser pulses, and the influence of nanorod orientation relative to the beam polarization on energy absorption. Our results indicate that the thermal equilibration at the particle/water interface takes approximately 500 ps, while the electron-lattice coupling is achieved at approximately 50 ps when a 48×14 nm gold nanorod is heated to a maximum temperature of 1270 K with the application of a laser pulse having 4.70 J/m(2) average fluence. Irradiation by multiple pulses arriving at 12.5 ns time intervals (80 MHz repetition rate) causes a temperature increase of no more than 3 degrees during the first few pulses with no substantial changes during the subsequent pulses. We also analyze the degree of the nanorods' heating as a function of their orientation with respect to the polarization of the incident light. Lastly, it is shown that the temperature change of a nanorod can be modeled using its volume equivalent sphere for femtosecond laser heating within 5-15{\%} accuracy.},

abstract = {Single molecule tracking in live cells is the ultimate tool to study subcellular protein dynamics, but it is often limited by the probe size and photostability. Because of these issues, long-term tracking of proteins in confined and crowded environments, such as intracellular spaces, remains challenging. We have developed a novel optical probe consisting of 5 nm gold nanoparticles functionalized with a small fragment of camelid antibodies that recognize widely used green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) with a very high affinity, which we call GFP-nanobodies. These small gold nanoparticles can be detected and tracked using photothermal imaging for arbitrarily long periods of time. Surface and intracellular GFP-proteins were effectively labeled even in very crowded environments such as adhesion sites and cytoskeletal structures both in vitro and in live cell cultures. These nanobody-coated gold nanoparticles are probes with unparalleled capabilities; small size, perfect photostability, high specificity, and versatility afforded by combination with the vast existing library of GFP-tagged proteins.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the plasmon-selective and driven deposition of (bipyramidal) Au nanoparticles on transparent substrates (glass coverslips) utilizing total internal reflection (TIR) illumination. Near-IR laser light undergoing TIR at a glass-water interface causes colloidal Au bipyramids to irreversibly deposit onto the glass surface. We demonstrate that the deposition process has particle (i.e., shape) selectivity that is associated with resonant plasmon excitation. Specifically, the deposition is selective for the bipyramids over spheroidal particles that are also present in solution due to the former's surface plasmon resonance in the near-IR region. Our measurements, finite difference time domain simulations, and the results of an analytical model show that the optical (i.e., scattering and gradient) forces that act on the particles are large and cause the observed acceleration and directed motion of the bipyramids. These directional forces play a major role in the spatial pattern of particle deposition that is observed. In addition, the resonant photothermal heating of the Au bipyramids causes an irreversible loss in colloidal stability, thus allowing them to adhere to the surface. Structural (i.e., scanning electron microscopy) characterization of the deposited bipyramids reveals a slight reduction in aspect ratio relative to the ensemble, consistent with the proposed (heating) mechanism. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of the plasmon-selective deposition of metal nanoparticles from a heterogeneous mixture.},

By fitting the emission PSF of single AuNR luminescence, we have shown that a 3-axis dipole PSF gives improved localization accuracy over the Gaussian PSF, especially for nonplanar AuNRs, while also allowing the AuNR three-dimensional orientation and emission wavelength to be determined. On the other hand, when a single-axis dipole PSF model is applied to the AuNR emission, the fit estimates converge to values that are inconsistent with their experimentally measured values, affecting both the localization accuracy and precision of the fitted centroid position. These results indicate that when applying superlocalization techniques to plasmonic nanostructures, care must be taken to understand the nature of the emission before a correct dipole PSF can be applied.},

The CTAB-NaOL binary surfactant mixture overcomes the difficulty of growing uniform thick gold NRs often associated with the single-component CTAB system and greatly expands the dimensions of gold NRs that are accessible through a one-pot seeded growth process. Gold NRs with large overall dimensions and thus high scattering/absorption ratios are ideal for scattering-based applications such as biolabeling as well as the enhancement of optical processes.},

abstract = {Sensitive probing of temperature variations on nanometre scales is an outstanding challenge in many areas of modern science and technology. In particular, a thermometer capable of subdegree temperature resolution over a large range of temperatures as well as integration within a living system could provide a powerful new tool in many areas of biological, physical and chemical research. Possibilities range from the temperature-induced control of gene expression and tumour metabolism to the cell-selective treatment of disease and the study of heat dissipation in integrated circuits. By combining local light-induced heat sources with sensitive nanoscale thermometry, it may also be possible to engineer biological processes at the subcellular level. Here we demonstrate a new approach to nanoscale thermometry that uses coherent manipulation of the electronic spin associated with nitrogen-vacancy colour centres in diamond. Our technique makes it possible to detect temperature variations as small as 1.8 mK (a sensitivity of 9 mK Hz(-1/2)) in an ultrapure bulk diamond sample. Using nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond nanocrystals (nanodiamonds), we directly measure the local thermal environment on length scales as short as 200 nanometres. Finally, by introducing both nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles into a single human embryonic fibroblast, we demonstrate temperature-gradient control and mapping at the subcellular level, enabling unique potential applications in life sciences.},

The spectra exhibit both red- and blue-shifted surface plasmon resonances, consistent with the plasmon hybridization model. However, the plasmon coupling constant for gold dimers with less than a few nanometers separation between the particles does not obey the exponential dependence predicted by the Universal Plasmon Ruler equation. The experimentally determined spectra are compared with electrodynamic calculations and the interactions between the individual rod plasmons in different dimer orientations are elucidated.},

abstract = {Enhancing the fluorescence of a weak emitter is important to further extend the reach of single-molecule fluorescence imaging to many unexplored systems. Here we study fluorescence enhancement by isolated gold nanorods and explore the role of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on the observed enhancements. Gold nanorods can be cheaply synthesized in large volumes, yet we find similar fluorescence enhancements as literature reports on lithographically fabricated nanoparticle assemblies. The fluorescence of a weak emitter, crystal violet, can be enhanced more than 1000-fold by a single nanorod with its SPR at 629 nm excited at 633 nm. This strong enhancement results from both an excitation rate enhancement of ∼130 and an effective emission enhancement of ∼9. The fluorescence enhancement, however, decreases sharply when the SPR wavelength moves away from the excitation laser wavelength or when the SPR has only a partial overlap with the emission spectrum of the fluorophore. The reported measurements of fluorescence enhancement by 11 nanorods with varying SPR wavelengths are consistent with numerical simulations.},

abstract = {The distance dependence of localized surface plasmon (LSP) coupled F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is experimentally and theoretically investigated using a trilayer structure composed of separated monolayers of donor and acceptor quantum dots with an intermediate Au nanoparticle layer. The dependence of the energy transfer efficiency, rate, and characteristic distance, as well as the enhancement of the acceptor emission, on the separations between the three constituent layers is examined. A d(-4) dependence of the energy transfer rate is observed for LSP-coupled FRET between the donor and acceptor planes with the increased energy transfer range described by an enhanced F{\"{o}}rster radius. The conventional FRET rate also follows a d(-4) dependence in this geometry. The conditions under which this distance dependence is valid for LSP-coupled FRET are theoretically investigated. The influence of the placement of the intermediate Au NP is investigated, and it is shown that donor-plasmon coupling has a greater influence on the characteristic energy transfer range in this LSP-coupled FRET system. The LSP-enhanced F{\"{o}}rster radius is dependent on the Au nanoparticle concentration. The potential to tune the characteristic energy transfer distance has implications for applications in nanophotonic devices or sensors.},

By creating samples with different densities of GNRs on silicon wafer substrates, we were able to determine surface coverage by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and then correlate the coverage to the CAS intensities of the samples. The observed CAS signal intensity was quadratically dependent on the number of particles. We also examined the CAS signal as a function of the excitation polarization and found that the strongest signals in regularly oriented GNRs were observed when the beam polarization was aligned with the longitudinal axis of the GNRs. Irregularly oriented GNRs exhibited a different scattering pattern to that observed for regularly oriented GNRs. The polarization-dependent scattering from oriented GNRs showed cos(6)($\theta$) behavior. By imaging nanoscale-sized GNR patterns using CAS and evaluating the results with SEM, we show that CAS can be used for efficient, label-free imaging of nanoscale metallic particles.},

This is a nontrivial task, as many of the physical characteristics of the medium and probe, e.g., viscosity, elasticity, shape, and density, are often unknown. Here, we suggest how to calibrate single beam optical tweezers in a complex viscoelastic environment. At the same time, we determine viscoelastic characteristics such as friction retardation spectrum and elastic moduli of the medium. We apply and test a method suggested [M. Fischer and K.

abstract = {Driven by the search for new materials with interesting and unique properties and also by the fundamental question of how atomic and molecular physical behaviour develops with increasing size, the field of nanoparticle research has grown immensely in the last two decades. Partially for these reasons, colloidal solutions of metallic (especially silver and gold) nanoparticles have long fascinated scientists because of their very intense colours. The intense red colour of colloidal gold nanoparticles is due to their surface plasmon absorption. This article describes the physical origin of the surface plasmon absorption in gold nanoparticles with emphasis on the Mie and also the Maxwell-Garnett theory and reviews the effects of particle size and shape on the resonance condition. A better understanding of the relationship between the optical absorption spectrum (in particular, the plasmon resonance) and such particle properties as its dimensions or surrounding environment can prove fruitful for the use of the plasmon absorption as an analytical tool. The plasmon resonance has also had a great impact on the Raman spectrum of surface-adsorbed molecules and a large enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield of gold nanorods is observed. Furthermore, following the changes in the plasmon absorption induced by excitation (heating) with ultrashort laser pulses allows one to monitor the electron dynamics (electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions) in real time, which is important in understanding such fundamental questions regarding the thermal and electrical conductivity of these nanoparticles. Very intense heating with laser pulses leads to structural changes of the nanoparticles (nuclear rearrangements in the form of melting and fragmentation).},

abstract = {The photothermal effect of plasmonic nanostructures has numerous applications, such as cancer therapy, photonic gene circuit, large cargo delivery, and nanostructure-enhanced laser tweezers. The photothermal operation can also induce unwanted physical and biochemical effects, which potentially alter the cell behaviors. However, there is a lack of techniques for characterizing the dynamic cell responses near the site of photothermal operation with high spatiotemporal resolution. In this work, we show that the incorporation of locked nucleic acid probes with gold nanorods allows photothermal manipulation and real-time monitoring of gene expression near the area of irradiation in living cells and animal tissues. The multimodal gold nanorod serves as an endocytic delivery reagent to transport the probes into the cells, a fluorescence quencher and a binding competitor to detect intracellular mRNA, and a plasmonic photothermal transducer to induce cell ablation. We demonstrate the ability of the gold nanorod-locked nucleic acid complex for detecting the spatiotemporal gene expression in viable cells and tissues and inducing photothermal ablation of single cells. Using the gold nanorod-locked nucleic acid complex, we systematically characterize the dynamic cellular heat shock responses near the site of photothermal operation. The gold nanorod-locked nucleic acid complex enables mapping of intracellular gene expressions and analyzes the photothermal effects of nanostructures toward various biomedical applications.},

For increasing the antenna length, the energy peak position decreases continuously until it reaches a value of 1.7–1.8 eV. For longer antennas and smaller plasmon energies, we observe an additional, persistent shoulder in the PL spectra, which we explain by a Gaussian-shaped peak at $\Delta$?≈1.78–1.79 eV. We attribute this behavior to the opening of an additional decay path for electrons at the gold interband transition edge, which we observe only for long antennas.},

They are particularly important for understanding irreversibility and the second law in fundamental chemical and biological processes that are actively driven, thus operating far from thermal equilibrium. Here, we apply the framework of fluctuation theorems to investigate the important case of a system relaxing from a non-equilibrium state towards equilibrium. Using a vacuum-trapped nanoparticle, we demonstrate experimentally the validity of a fluctuation theorem for the relative entropy change occurring during relaxation from a non-equilibrium steady state. The platform established here allows non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to be studied experimentally for arbitrary steady states and can be extended to investigate quantum fluctuation theorems as well as systems that do not obey detailed balance.},

We perform both electromagnetic and thermodynamic calculations based upon a time-efficient boundary element method. Two kinds of plasmonic systems are investigated in order to illustrate the potential of such a technique. First, we focus on individual particles with various morphologies. In analogy with electrostatics, we introduce the concept of thermal capacitance. This geometry-dependent quantity allows us to assess the temperature increase inside a plasmonic particle from the sole knowledge of its absorption cross section. We present universal thermal-capacitance curves for ellipsoids, rods, disks, and rings. Additionally, we investigate assemblies of nanoparticles in close proximity and show that, despite its diffusive nature, the temperature distribution can be made highly non-uniform even at the nanoscale using plasmonic systems. A significant degree of nanoscale control over the individual temperatures of neighboring particles is demonstrated, depending on the external light wavelength and direction of incidence. We illustrate this concept with simulations of gold sphere dimers and chains in water. Our work opens new possibilities for selectively controlling processes such as local melting for dynamic patterning of textured materials, chemical and metabolic thermal activation, and heat delivery for producing mechanical motion with spatial precision in the nanoscale.},

Bubble formation is explosive even under continuous-wave heating. The fast, inertia-governed expansion is followed by a slower contraction and disappearance after some tens of nanoseconds. In a narrow range of illumination powers, bubble time traces show a clear echo signature. We attribute it to sound waves released upon the initial explosion and reflected by flat interfaces, hundreds of microns away from the particle. Echoes can trigger new explosions. A nanobubble's steady state (with a vapor shell surrounding the heated nanoparticle) can be reached by a proper time profile of the heating intensity. Stable nanobubbles could have original applications for light modulation and for enhanced optical–acoustic coupling in photoacoustic microscopy.},

The theory of the DDA and its implementation in DDSCAT is presented in Draine (1988) and Draine {\&} Flatau (1994), and its extension to periodic structures in Draine {\&} Flatau (2008), and efficient near-field calculations in Flatau {\&} Draine (2012). DDSCAT 7.3 includes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL). DDSCAT supports calculations for a variety of target geometries. Target materials may be both inhomogeneous and anisotropic. It is straightforward for the user to "import" arbitrary target geometries into the code. DDSCAT automatically calculates total cross sections for absorption and scattering and selected elements of the Mueller scattering intensity matrix for user-specified scattering directions. DDSCAT 7.3 can efficiently calculate E and B throughout a user-specified volume containing the target. This User Guide explains how to use DDSCAT 7.3 to carry out electromagnetic scattering calculations, including use of DDPOSTPROCESS, a Fortran-90 code to perform calculations with E and B at user-selected locations near the target.

The luminescence intensity scales as a second-order function of the excitation power, with a quantum yield ∼1/50 of down-conversion luminescence when illuminated at a power of 30 MW/cm(2). The luminescence spectrum is completely different than the SPR profile, indicating a new emission mechanism possibly involving interband transitions coupled with phonons or localized vibration of neighboring gold atoms. Such luminescence is also observed to be substantial for short gold nanorods with an aspect ratio of ∼2 but weak for bulk gold.

abstract = {A variation of fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR) suitable for measuring the rate of rotational molecular diffusion in solution and cell membranes is presented in theory and experimental practice for epi-illumination microscopy. In this technique, a brief flash of polarized laser light creates an anisotropic distribution of unbleached fluorophores which relaxes by rotational diffusion, leading to a time-dependent postbleach fluorescence. Polarized FPR (PFPR) is applicable to any time scales from seconds to microseconds. However, at fast (microsecond) time scales, a partial recovery independent of molecular orientation tends to obscure rotational effects. The theory here presents a method for overcoming this reversible photobleaching, and includes explicit results for practical geometries, fast wobble of fluorophores, and arbitrary bleaching depth. This variation of a polarized luminescence "pump-and-probe" technique is compared with prior ones and with "pump-only" time-resolved luminescence anisotropy decay methods. The technique is experimentally verified on small latex beads with a variety of diameters, common fluorophore labels, and solvent viscosities. Preliminary measurements on a protein (acetylcholine receptor) in the membrane of nondeoxygenated cells in live culture (rat myotubes) show a difference in rotational diffusion between clustered and nonclustered receptors. In most experiments, signal averaging, high laser power, and automated sample translation must be employed to achieve adequate statistical accuracy.},

Two techniques for primary particle size measurements, based on ratios of laser-induced incandescence signals from a single laser pulse, were also examined. Compared with the ratio of two integration times, the newly proposed ratio of two detection wavelengths is better suited for simultaneous volume fraction and size measurements, because it is less temperature sensitive and produces stronger signals with, however, a lower sensitivity to size changes.},

abstract = {Light emission resulting from two-photon excited gold nanoparticles has been proposed to originate from the radiative decay of surface plasmon resonances. In this vein, we investigated luminescence from individual gold nanorods and found that their emission characteristics closely resemble surface plasmon behavior. In particular, we observed spectral similarities between the scattering spectra of individual nanorods and their photoluminescence emission. We also measured a blueshift of the photoluminescence peak wavelength with decreasing aspect ratio of the nanorods as well as an optically tunable shape-dependent spectrum of the photoluminescence. The emission yield of single nanorods strongly depends on the orientation of the incident polarization consistent with the properties of surface plasmons.},

abstract = {Plasmonic nanostructures are of great current interest as chemical sensors, in vivo imaging agents, and for photothermal therapeutics. We study continuous-wave (cw) and pulsed-laser excitation of aqueous suspensions of Au nanorods as a model system for secondary light emission from plasmonic nanostructures. Resonant secondary emission contributes significantly to the background commonly observed in surface-enhanced Raman scattering and to the light emission generated by pulsed-laser excitation of metallic nanostructures that is often attributed to two-photon luminescence. Spectra collected using cw laser excitation at 488 nm show an enhancement of the broad spectrum of emission at the electromagnetic plasmon resonance of the nanorods. The intensity of anti-Stokes emission collected using cw laser excitation at 785 nm is described by a 300 K thermal distribution of excitations. Excitation by subpicosecond laser pulses at 785 nm broadens and increases the intensity of the anti-Stokes emission in a manner that is consistent with electronic Raman scattering by a high-temperature distribution of electronic excitations predicted by a two-temperature model. Broadening of the pulse duration using an etalon reduces the intensity of anti-Stokes emission in quantitative agreement with the model. Experiments using a pair of subpicosecond optical pulses separated by a variable delay show that the timescale of resonant secondary emission is comparable to the timescale for equilibration of electrons and phonons.},

abstract = {We constructed a next-generation optical trapping instrument to study the motility of single motor proteins, such as kinesin moving along a microtubule. The instrument can be operated as a two-dimensional force clamp, applying loads of fixed magnitude and direction to motor-coated microscopic beads moving in vitro. Flexibility and automation in experimental design are achieved by computer control of both the trap position, via acousto-optic deflectors, and the sample position, using a three-dimensional piezo stage. Each measurement is preceded by an initialization sequence, which includes adjustment of bead height relative to the coverslip using a variant of optical force microscopy (to +/-4 nm), a two-dimensional raster scan to calibrate position detector response, and adjustment of bead lateral position relative to the microtubule substrate (to +/-3 nm). During motor-driven movement, both the trap and stage are moved dynamically to apply constant force while keeping the trapped bead within the calibrated range of the detector. We present details of force clamp operation and preliminary data showing kinesin motor movement subject to diagonal and forward loads.},

Unfortunately plasmonic metamaterials demonstrating this effect has been restricted to infrared and greater wavelengths due to requisite precision in structure fabrication. Here we report a novel metamaterial synthesized by bottom-up self-assembly of gold nanorods. The small dimensions (≤ 50/20 nm, length/diameter), atomically smooth surfaces, and nanometer resolution enable the first demonstration of plasmon-induced transparency at visible wavelengths. The slow-down factors within the reduced symmetry heterodimer cluster are comparable to longer wavelength counterparts. The inherent spectral tunability and facile large-scale integration afforded by self-assembled metamaterials will open a new paradigm for physically realizable on-chip photonic device designs.},

They are particularly important for understanding irreversibility and the second law in fundamental chemical and biological processes that are actively driven, thus operating far from thermal equilibrium. Here, we apply the framework of fluctuation theorems to investigate the important case of a system relaxing from a non-equilibrium state towards equilibrium. Using a vacuum-trapped nanoparticle, we demonstrate experimentally the validity of a fluctuation theorem for the relative entropy change occurring during relaxation from a non-equilibrium steady state. The platform established here allows non-equilibrium fluctuation theorems to be studied experimentally for arbitrary steady states and can be extended to investigate quantum fluctuation theorems as well as systems that do not obey detailed balance.},

Although their potential is still not fully utilized, their specifically polarized field distribution gives rise to a wide field of applications. They are contributing to complete our fundamental knowledge of the optical properties of single emitting species, such as molecules, nanoparticles, or quantum dots, offering insight into the three-dimensional dipole or particle orientation in space. The perfect zero intensity in the focus center qualifies some DMs for stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy.

abstract = {Many cellular processes are carried out by molecular 'machines'-assemblies of multiple differentiated proteins that physically interact to execute biological functions. Despite much speculation, strong evidence of the mechanisms by which these assemblies evolved is lacking. Here we use ancestral gene resurrection and manipulative genetic experiments to determine how the complexity of an essential molecular machine--the hexameric transmembrane ring of the eukaryotic V-ATPase proton pump--increased hundreds of millions of years ago. We show that the ring of Fungi, which is composed of three paralogous proteins, evolved from a more ancient two-paralogue complex because of a gene duplication that was followed by loss in each daughter copy of specific interfaces by which it interacts with other ring proteins. These losses were complementary, so both copies became obligate components with restricted spatial roles in the complex. Reintroducing a single historical mutation from each paralogue lineage into the resurrected ancestral proteins is sufficient to recapitulate their asymmetric degeneration and trigger the requirement for the more elaborate three-component ring. Our experiments show that increased complexity in an essential molecular machine evolved because of simple, high-probability evolutionary processes, without the apparent evolution of novel functions. They point to a plausible mechanism for the evolution of complexity in other multi-paralogue protein complexes.},

abstract = {Existing methods for the optical detection of single molecules require the molecules to absorb light to produce fluorescence or direct absorption signals. This limits the range of species that can be detected, because most molecules are purely refractive. Metal nanoparticles or dielectric resonators can be used to detect non-absorbing molecules because local changes in the refractive index produce a resonance shift. However, current approaches only detect single molecules when the resonance shift is amplified by a highly polarizable label or by a localized precipitation reaction on the surface of a nanoparticle. Without such amplification, single-molecule events can only be identified in a statistical way. Here, we report the plasmonic detection of single molecules in real time without the need for labelling or amplification. Our sensor consists of a single gold nanorod coated with biotin receptors, and the binding of single proteins is detected by monitoring the plasmon resonance of the nanorod with a sensitive photothermal assay. The sensitivity of our device is ∼700 times higher than state-of-the-art plasmon sensors and is intrinsically limited by spectral diffusion of the surface plasmon resonance.},

Experiments were performed with wide field irradiation. At the ensemble level, the linearly polarized irradiation was used to induce a photoselection by bleaching, which is compensated by rotational diffusion. Both results show an appreciable difference in mobility of NR in the films that is correlated with the different glass-transition temperatures of the films, particularly in PEMA, which displays a clearly distinct behavior between the 200 nm films, representing a rigid environment, and the 25 nm ones, showing much higher mobility. We developed a model of broad application for polarized photobleaching that allows obtaining rotational diffusion coefficients and photobleaching quantum yields in an easy way from ensemble experiments. The parameters obtained from ensemble measurements correlate well with the results from SM experiments.},

abstract = {Noble-metal particles feature intriguing optical properties, which can be utilized to manipulate them by means of light. Light absorbed by gold nanoparticles, for example, is very efficiently converted into heat, and single particles can thus be used as a fine tool to apply heat to a nanoscopic area. At the same time, gold nanoparticles are subject to optical forces when they are irradiated with a focused laser beam, which renders it possible to print, manipulate, and optically trap them in two and three dimensions. Here, we demonstrate how these properties can be used to control the polymerization reaction and thermal curing of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) at the nanoscale and how these findings can be applied to synthesize polymer nanostructures such as particles and nanowires with subdiffraction limited resolution.},

abstract = {Recent studies have firmly established that cellular uptake of nanoparticles is strongly affected by the presence and the physicochemical properties of a protein adsorption layer around these nanoparticles. Here, we have modified human serum albumin (HSA), a serum protein often used in model studies of protein adsorption onto nanoparticles, to alter its surface charge distribution and investigated the consequences for protein corona formation around small (radius ∼5 nm), dihydrolipoic acid-coated quantum dots (DHLA-QDs) by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. HSA modified by succinic anhydride (HSAsuc) to generate additional carboxyl groups on the protein surface showed a 3-fold decreased binding affinity toward the nanoparticles. A 1000-fold enhanced affinity was observed for HSA modified by ethylenediamine (HSAam) to increase the number of amino functions on the protein surface. Remarkably, HSAsuc formed a much thicker protein adsorption layer (8.1 nm) than native HSA (3.3 nm), indicating that it binds in a distinctly different orientation on the nanoparticle, whereas the HSAam corona (4.6 nm) is only slightly thicker. Notably, protein binding to DHLA-QDs was found to be entirely reversible, independent of the modification. We have also measured the extent and kinetics of internalization of these nanoparticles without and with adsorbed native and modified HSA by HeLa cells. Pronounced variations were observed, indicating that even small physicochemical changes of the protein corona may affect biological responses.},

Examples include collectively searching for resources, choosing when and where to invest time and effort, and many more. Although a hierarchical ordering of the relevance of the group members' inputs during collective decision making is abundant, a quantitative demonstration of its origin and advantages using a generic approach has not been described yet. Here we introduce a family of models based on the most general features of group decision making, and show that the optimal distribution of competences is a highly skewed function with a structured fat tail. Our results are obtained by optimizing the groups' compositions through identifying the best-performing distributions for both the competences and for the members' flexibilities/pliancies. Potential applications include choosing the best composition for a group intended to solve a given task.},

abstract = {The discovery of the photoelectric effect by Heinrich Hertz in 1887 set the foundation for over 125 years of hot carrier science and technology. In the early 1900s it played a critical role in the development of quantum mechanics, but even today the unique properties of these energetic, hot carriers offer new and exciting opportunities for fundamental research and applications. Measurement of the kinetic energy and momentum of photoejected hot electrons can provide valuable information on the electronic structure of materials. The heat generated by hot carriers can be harvested to drive a wide range of physical and chemical processes. Their kinetic energy can be used to harvest solar energy or create sensitive photodetectors and spectrometers. Photoejected charges can also be used to electrically dope two-dimensional materials. Plasmon excitations in metallic nanostructures can be engineered to enhance and provide valuable control over the emission of hot carriers. This Review discusses recent advances in the understanding and application of plasmon-induced hot carrier generation and highlights some of the exciting new directions for the field.},

abstract = {The temperature distribution throughout arrays of illuminated metal nanoparticles is investigated numerically and experimentally. The two cases of continuous and femtosecond-pulsed illumination are addressed. In the case of continuous illumination, two distinct regimes are evidenced: a temperature confinement regime, where the temperature increase remains confined at the vicinity of each nanosource of heat, and a temperature delocalization regime, where the temperature is uniform throughout the whole nanoparticle assembly despite the heat sources' nanometric size. We show that the occurrence of one regime or another simply depends on the geometry of the nanoparticle distribution. In particular, we derived (i) simple expressions of dimensionless parameters aimed at predicting the degree of temperature confinement and (ii) analytical expressions aimed at estimating the actual temperature increase at the center of an assembly of nanoparticles under illumination, preventing heavy numerical simulations. All these theoretical results are supported by experimental measurements of the temperature distribution on regular arrays of gold nanoparticles under illumination. In the case of femtosecond-pulsed illumination, we explain the two conditions that must be fulfilled to observe a further enhanced temperature spatial confinement.},

The results are interpreted in terms of the Holstein theories of phonon-assisted and surface-assisted absorption. These theories are found to provide an accurate description of the absorptivity, when allowance is made for anisotropy of the electron-phonon relaxation time over the Fermi surface. Values of this anisotropy are obtained. The average scattering of electrons at the metal surface is found to be nearly completely diffuse.},

The unique capabilities of visualizing and understanding rotational motions of functional nanoparticles on live cell membranes allow correlation of the rotational and translational dynamics in unprecedented detail and provide new insights into complex membrane processes.

A prominent new direction explores the various interactions between molecules within individual multichromophoric systems obtained by chemical synthesis. These systems are the models for natural self-assembled systems such as the light-harvesting proteins of bacteria and green plants, which are currently studied on a single-molecule basis. Another important class of multichromophoric systems are conjugated polymers.

A resonant optical antenna, tuned to operation in the visible, is carved into the aluminum-coated scanning probe. The antenna resonances, field localization, excitation, and polarization response are probed in the near-field by scanning over single fluorescent nanobeads. At the same time, the distance-dependent coupling of the emission to the antenna mode is mapped. Good agreement with theory is obtained. The presented scanning antenna approach is useful for both nanoscale plasmonic mode imaging and (bio)imaging.},

abstract = {Using our nanocavity-based method for precise determination of the absolute quantum yield values, we measure the quantum yield of each of the three different chromophores types with strongly overlapping absorption spectra in a multicolor solution, which is impossible to do by any other existing technique. By measuring the modification of the radiative rate of the chromophores at different cavity lengths, we extract the quantum yield of CdSe/ZnS semiconductor nanocrystals emitting at three different wavelengths and excited by a single wavelength in the multicolor solution. Using several detection channels, we show that only one measurement is needed for determining the quantum yield values of all the types of chromophores in the sample. The obtained results show a very good agreement with the values commonly observed using other techniques. The nanocavity-based method opens up new opportunities of determining fluorescence quantum yields in complex systems and can be used for a big variety of fluorescence studies where multichromophore samples are involved.},

@article{Zondervan2008,
abstract = {We probe the mechanical response of two supercooled liquids, glycerol and ortho-terphenyl, by conducting rheological experiments at very weak stresses. We find a complex fluid behavior suggesting the gradual emergence of an extended, delicate solid-like network in both materials in the supercooled state-i.e., above the glass transition. This network stiffens as it ages, and very early in this process it already extends over macroscopic distances, conferring all well known features of soft glassy rheology (yield-stress, shear thinning, aging) to the supercooled liquids. Such viscoelastic behavior of supercooled molecular glass formers is difficult to observe because the large stresses in conventional rheology can easily shear-melt the solid-like structure. The work presented here, combined with evidence for long-lived heterogeneity from previous single-molecule studies [Zondervan R, Kulzer F, Berkhout GCG, Orrit M (2007) Local viscosity of supercooled glycerol near T(g) probed by rotational diffusion of ensembles and single dye molecules. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:12628-12633], has a profound impact on the understanding of the glass transition because it casts doubt on the widely accepted assumption of the preservation of ergodicity in the supercooled state.},

ISM then generates an image with nearly doubled resolution. Using conventional fluorophores, we have imaged single nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear membrane and aggregates of GFP-conjugated Tau protein in three dimensions. Multicolor ISM was shown on cytoskeletal-associated structural proteins and on 3D four-color images including MitoTracker and Hoechst staining. The simple adaptation of conventional CSD equipment allows superresolution investigations of a broad variety of cell biological questions.},

abstract = {Accurate thermometry at micro- and nanoscales is essential in many nanobiotechnological applications. The nanothermometers introduced in this paper are composed of labeled molecular beacons (MBs) comprising gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on which, depending on application, many MBs of one or more types are immobilized. In this design, three differently labeled MBs with different thermostabilities function as the sensing elements, and AuNPs act as carriers of the MBs and also quenchers of their fluorophores. This flexible design results in a number of nanothermometers with various temperature-sensing ranges. At the lowest temperature, the MBs are in the closed form, where they are quenched. By increasing the temperature, the MBs start to open with respect to their melting points (Tm), and as a result, the fluorescence emission will increase. The temperature resolution of the nanoprobes over a range of 15-60 °C is less than 0.50 °C, which indicates their high sensitivity. Such a good temperature resolution is a result of the specific design of the unusual less stable MBs and also presence of many MBs on AuNPs. The reproducibility and precision of the probes are also satisfactory. The multiplex MB nanoprobe is suitable for thermal imaging by fluorescence microscopy.},

Magnetite particles (ca. 6 nm) were synthesized by microwave-assisted thermal decomposition of iron acetylacetonate and subsequently functionalized following a click chemistry protocol to obtain biotin and E-64 labeled particulate systems. Successful surface modification and covalent attachment of functional groups and molecules were confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy and thermal gravimetric analysis. The ability of the surface-grafted biotin terminal groups to specifically interact with streptavidin (either horseradish peroxidase [(HRP)-luminol-H2O2] or rhodamine) was confirmed by chemiluminescent assay. A quantitative assessment showed a capture limit of 0.55-1.65 $\mu$g protein/100 $\mu$g particles. Furthermore, E-64@SPIONs were successfully used to specifically label papain-like cysteine proteases from crude plant extracts. Owing to the simplicity and versatility of the technique, together with the superparamagnetic behavior of FeOx-nanoparticles, the results demonstrate that click chemistry on surface anchored azide group is a viable approach toward bioconjugations that can be extended to other nanoparticles surfaces with different functional groups to target specific therapeutic and diagnostic applications.},

Even without genetic mutations, Darwinian selection can expand these resistant variants, which would explain the invariably rapid emergence of stem-like resistant cells. Here, by using quantitative measurements and modelling, we show that appearance of multidrug resistance in HL60 leukemic cells following treatment with vincristine is not explained by Darwinian selection but by Lamarckian induction. Single-cell longitudinal monitoring confirms the induction of multidrug resistance in individual cells. Associated transcriptome changes indicate a lasting stress response consistent with a drug-induced switch between high-dimensional cancer attractors. Resistance induction correlates with Wnt pathway upregulation and is suppressed by $\beta$-catenin knockdown, revealing a new opportunity for early therapeutic intervention against the development of drug resistance.},

The approach allows for the statistical analysis of single-molecule interactions without requiring any labeling of the analyte. We study an antibody-antigen interaction and find that the waiting-time distribution is concentration-dependent and obeys Poisson statistics. The ability to probe hundreds of nanoparticles simultaneously will provide a sensor with a dynamic range of 7 decades in concentration and will enable the study of heterogeneity in molecular interactions.},

One Au nanoparticle is attached to a scanning fiber probe and the second to a scanning substrate. This configuration allows three-dimensional and arbitrary manipulation of both distance and relative orientation with respect to the incident light polarization. As supported by numerical simulations, a periodic modulation of the coupled plasmon resonance is observed for separations smaller than 1.5 microm. This interparticle coupling affects the scattering cross section in terms of spectral position and spectral width as well as the integral intensity of the Mie-scattered light.},

abstract = {A broad visible and infrared photoluminescence continuum is detected from surface-plasmon-enhanced transitions in gold nanostructures. We find that the ratio of generated infrared to visible emission is much stronger for gold nanostructures than for smooth gold films. While visible emission is well explained by interband transitions of d-band electrons into the conduction band and subsequent radiative recombination, the strong infrared emission cannot be accounted for by the same mechanism. We propose that the infrared emission is generated by intraband transitions mediated by the strongly confined fields near metal nanostruc- tures ?localized surface plasmons?. These fields possess wave numbers that are comparable to the wave numbers of electrons in the metal, and the associated field gradients give rise to higher-order multipolar transitions.We compare photoluminescence spectra for single gold spheres, smooth and rough gold films, and sharp gold tips and demonstrate that the infrared signal is only present for surfaces with nanometer-scale roughness.},

abstract = {Developing molecular systems with functions analogous to those of macroscopic machine components, such as rotors, gyroscopes and valves, is a long-standing goal of nanotechnology. However, macroscopic analogies go only so far in predicting function in nanoscale environments, where friction dominates over inertia. In some instances, ratchet mechanisms have been used to bias the ever-present random, thermally driven (Brownian) motion and drive molecular diffusion in desired directions. Here, we visualize the motions of surface-bound molecular rotors using defocused fluorescence imaging, and observe the transition from hindered to free Brownian rotation by tuning medium viscosity. We show that the otherwise random rotations can be biased by the polarization of the excitation light field, even though the associated optical torque is insufficient to overcome thermal fluctuations. The biased rotation is attributed instead to a fluctuating-friction mechanism in which photoexcitation of the rotor strongly inhibits its diffusion rate.},

abstract = {The chemical stability of gold nanorods in different environments is important for a variety of practical applications, because the tiny change in shape and size could directly affect the optical properties of the gold nanorods. Herein we report a chemical etching reaction of the gold nanorods induced by ferric chloride at room temperature. In the chemical etching, halide ions act as a ligand to reduce the electron potential of the gold species, which enables ferric ions to oxidize the gold nanorods and results in the etching of the gold nanorods. The redox etching leads to a significant decrease of the gold nanorods in length but little change in diameter, which could be attributed to less surface passivation or higher chemical reactivity of the tips of the gold nanorods. It is believed that the selective shortening not only provides an alternative way to obtain the gold nanorods with desirable aspect ratios and specific optical properties, but also offers a safe way to remove gold nanostructures, which is important for the preparation of hollow nanostructures with gold as a template.},

We measured photoluminescence and scattering spectra from 82 gold nanorods using single-particle spectroscopy. We found that the emission and scattering spectra closely resemble each other independent of the nanorod aspect ratio. We assign the photoluminescence to the radiative decay of the longitudinal surface plasmon generated after fast interconversion from excited electron-hole pairs that were initially created by 532 nm excitation. The emission intensity was converted to the quantum yield and was found to approximately exponentially decrease as the energy difference between the excitation and emission wavelength increased for gold nanorods with plasmon resonances between 600 and 800 nm. We compare this plasmon emission to its molecular analogue, fluorescence.},

abstract = {Strain-induced changes to the electronic structure of nanoscale materials provide a promising avenue for expanding the optoelectronic functionality of semiconductor nanostructures in device applications. Here we use pump-probe microscopy with femtosecond temporal resolution and sub-micron spatial resolution to characterize charge-carrier recombination and transport dynamics in silicon nanowires (NWs) locally strained by bending deformation. The electron-hole recombination rate increases with strain for values above a threshold of {\~{}}1{\%}, and in highly-strained ({\~{}}5{\%}) regions of the NW, increases six-fold. The changes in recombination rate are independent of NW diameter and reversible upon reduction of the applied strain, indicating the effect originates from alterations to the NW bulk electronic structure rather than introduction of defects. The results highlight the strong relationship between strain, electronic structure, and charge-carrier dynamics in low-dimensional semiconductor systems, and we anticipate the results will assist the development of strain-enabled optoelectronic devices with indirect-bandgap materials such as silicon.},

abstract = {New results about relaxation dynamics of optically excited electrons in metals, mostly gold and nickel films, are presented. Emphasis is on electron temperature near the surface as well as on the range of energy transport by ballistic and diffusive electron motion in comparison to the optical penetration depth. The experiments focus on the interval between creation of an electron temperature and the time at which thermal equilibrium between electrons and lattice is reached. Results were obtained by time-resolved linear and second-harmonic reflectivity measurements carried out in pump-probe mode. It is shown that the two-temperature model is well suited to describe hot electron diffusion in metals and to extract electron–phonon coupling constants from experimental data, provided corrections for ballistic electron motion are incorporated. The electron–phonon coupling constant of gold was found to be independent of film thickness down to 10 nm. For noble metals, probe reflectivities near the interband transition were related to electron temperatures by a proper model for the dielectric function. For transition metals such relation between reflectivity and electron temperature is more difficult. A new pump-pump-probe technique was introduced which allows to study hot electron relaxation by probing the reflectivity in thermal equilibrium between electrons and lattice. Also these results can be well described by the two-temperature model. Finally, the interface sensitivity of the second harmonic was utilized to detect vibrational motion and thermal expansion of ultrathin nickel films on Cu(001).},

The etching process effectively makes the surface tension isotropic, so that spheres are favored under quasi-static conditions. It is scalable up to particle sizes of 200 nm or more. The resulting spherical crystals display uniform scattering spectra and consistent optical coupling at small separations, even showing Fano-like resonances in small clusters. The high monodispersity of the particles we demonstrate should facilitate the self-assembly of nanoparticle clusters with uniform optical resonances, which could in turn be used to fabricate optical metafluids. Narrow size distributions are required to control not only the spectral features but also the morphology and yield of clusters in certain assembly schemes.},

We identify the role of plasmons in photoluminescence as modulating the energy transfer between excited electrons and emitted photons. By comparing photoluminescence spectra with scattering spectra, we observed that the photoluminescence of individual gold nanostructures showed the same dependencies on shape, size, and plasmon coupling as the particle plasmon resonances. Our results provide conclusive evidence that the photoluminescence in gold nanostructures indeed occurs via radiative damping of plasmon resonances driven by excited electrons in the metal itself. Moreover, we provide new insight on the underlying mechanism based on our analysis of a reproducible blue shift of the photoluminescence peak (relative to the scattering peak) and observation of an incomplete depolarization of the photoluminescence.},

abstract = {Due to strong electric fields at the surface, the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by noble metal nanoparticles are strongly enhanced. These unique properties provide the potential of designing novel optically active reagents for simultaneous molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. It is desirable to use agents that are active in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the radiation spectrum to minimize the light extinction by intrinsic chromophores in native tissue. Gold nanorods with suitable aspect ratios (length divided by width) can absorb and scatter strongly in the NIR region (650-900 nm). In the present work, we provide an in vitro demonstration of gold nanorods as novel contrast agents for both molecular imaging and photothermal cancer therapy. Nanorods are synthesized and conjugated to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies and incubated in cell cultures with a nonmalignant epithelial cell line (HaCat) and two malignant oral epithelial cell lines (HOC 313 clone 8 and HSC 3). The anti-EGFR anti body-conjugated nanorods bind specifically to the surface of the malignant-type cells with a much higher affinity due to the overexpressed EGFR on the cytoplasmic membrane of the malignant cells. As a result of the strongly scattered red light from gold nanorods in dark field, observed using a laboratory microscope, the malignant cells are clearly visualized and diagnosed from the nonmalignant cells. It is found that, after exposure to continuous red laser at 800 nm, malignant cells require about half the laser energy to be photothermally destroyed than the nonmalignant cells. Thus, both efficient cancer cell diagnostics and selective photothermal therapy are realized at the same time.},

abstract = {Plasmon enhancement of optical properties is both fundamentally important and appealing for many biological and photonic applications. Although metal-enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence has been demonstrated in the solid substrates, there is no report on metal enhanced overall two-photon excitation fluorescence in the colloid system. Here we systematically investigated gold nanorod enhanced one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence of a porphyrin molecule, T790. The separation distance between the metal core and T790 was varied by adjusting the silica shell thickness from 13 to 42 nm. One- and two-photon excitation fluorescence intensities of T790 were found to strongly depend on the thickness of silica shell that separates gold nanorod and T790. The optimum one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement was found to occur at shell thicknesses of 34 and 20 nm, with enhancement factors of 2.1 and 11.8, respectively. Fluorescence lifetime of T790 steadily decreased as the shell thickness decreased. The observed two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement is ascribed to a combination effect of local electric field amplification and competition between increased radiative and non-radiative decay rates. Core-shell nanoparticles that displayed enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence were also found to exhibit significantly improved singlet oxygen generation capability under two-photon excitation. The applications of these nanoparticles as effective agents for two-photon cell imaging and nano-photosensitizers for two-photon photodynamic therapy with improved efficiency have also been demonstrated in HepG2 cancer cells. The combined advantages of enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence and two-photon induced singlet oxygen generation make these core-shell nanoparticles as attractive agents for two-photon imaging guided two-photon photodynamic therapy.},

The proteomic snapshot of organelle marker proteins revealed that an atypical macropinocytic-like mechanism mediated the entry of nanoparticles. We show that the entry mechanism is controlled by actin reorganization, atypical macropinocytic signaling, and ADP-ribosylation factor 1. Additionally, our proteomics data demonstrated a central role for multivesicular bodies and multilamellar lysosomes in trafficking and final nanoparticle storage. This was confirmed by confocal microscopy and cryo-TEM measurements. By quantitatively analyzing the protein composition of nanoparticle-containing vesicles, our study clearly defines the routes of nanoparticle entry, intracellular trafficking, and the proteomic milieu of a nanoparticle-containing vesicle.},

abstract = {Kinesin, a mechanoenzyme that couples ATP hydrolysis to movement along microtubules, is thought to power vesicle transport and other forms of microtubule-based motility. Here, microscopic silica beads were precoated with carrier protein, exposed to low concentrations of kinesin, and individually manipulated with a single-beam gradient-force optical particle trap ('optical tweezers') directly onto microtubules. Optical tweezers greatly improved the efficiency of the bead assay, particularly at the lowest kinesin concentrations (corresponding to approximately 1 molecule per bead). Beads incubated with excess kinesin moved smoothly along a microtubule for many micrometres, but beads carrying from 0.17-3 kinesin molecules per bead, moved, on average, only about 1.4 microns and then spontaneously released from the microtubule. Application of the optical trap directly behind such moving beads often pulled them off the microtubule and back into the centre of the trap. This did not occur when a bead was bound by an AMP.PNP-induced rigor linkage, or when beads were propelled by several kinesin molecules. Our results are consistent with a model in which kinesin detaches briefly from the microtubule during a part of each mechanochemical cycle, rather than a model in which kinesin remains bound at all times.},

abstract = {The open-source code ADDA is described, which implements the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), a method to simulate light scattering by finite 3D objects of arbitrary shape and composition. Besides standard sequential execution, ADDA can run on a multiprocessor distributed-memory system, parallelizing a single DDA calculation. Hence the size parameter of the scatterer is in principle limited only by total available memory and computational speed. ADDA is written in C99 and is highly portable. It provides full control over the scattering geometry (particle morphology and orientation, and incident beam) and allows one to calculate a wide variety of integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities (cross sections, the Mueller matrix, etc.). Moreover, ADDA incorporates a range of state-of-the-art DDA improvements, aimed at increasing the accuracy and computational speed of the method. We discuss both physical and computational aspects of the DDA simulations and provide a practical introduction into performing such simulations with the ADDA code. We also present several simulation results, in particular, for a sphere with size parameter 320 (100-wavelength diameter) and refractive index 1.05.},

@article{Hu2008,
abstract = {This article provides a review of our recent Rayleigh scattering measurements on single metal nanoparticles. Two different systems will be discussed in detail: gold nanorods with lengths between 30 and 80 nm, and widths between 8 and 30 nm; and hollow gold-silver nanocubes (termed nanoboxes or nanocages depending on their exact morphology) with edge lengths between 100 and 160 nm, and wall thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. The goal of this work is to understand how the linewidth of the localized surface plasmon resonance depends on the size, shape, and environment of the nanoparticles. Specifically, the relative contributions from bulk dephasing, electron-surface scattering, and radiation damping (energy loss via coupling to the radiation field) have been determined by examining particles with different dimensions. This separation is possible because the magnitude of the radiation damping effect is proportional to the particle volume, whereas, the electron-surface scattering contribution is inversely proportional to the dimensions. For the nanorods, radiation damping is the dominant effect for thick rods (widths greater than 20 nm), while electron-surface scattering is dominant for thin rods (widths less than 10 nm). Rods with widths in between these limits have narrow resonances-approaching the value determined by the bulk contribution. For nanoboxes and nanocages, both radiation damping and electron-surface scattering are significant at all sizes. This is because these materials have thin walls, but large edge lengths and, therefore, relatively large volumes. The effect of the environment on the localized surface plasmon resonance has also been studied for nanoboxes. Increasing the dielectric constant of the surroundings causes a red-shift and an increase in the linewidth of the plasmon band. The increase in linewidth is attributed to enhanced radiation damping.},

abstract = {The use of lasers, over the past few decades, has emerged to be highly promising for cancer therapy modalities, most commonly the photothermal therapy method, which employs light absorbing dyes for achieving the photothermal damage of tumors, and the photodynamic therapy, which employs chemical photosensitizers that generate singlet oxygen that is capable of tumor destruction. However, recent advances in the field of nanoscience have seen the emergence of noble metal nanostructures with unique photophysical properties, well suited for applications in cancer phototherapy. Noble metal nanoparticles, on account of the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance, possess strongly enhanced visible and near-infrared light absorption, several orders of magnitude more intense compared to conventional laser phototherapy agents. The use of plasmonic nanoparticles as highly enhanced photoabsorbing agents has thus introduced a much more selective and efficient cancer therapy strategy, viz. plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT). The synthetic tunability of the optothermal properties and the bio-targeting abilities of the plasmonic gold nanostructures make the PPTT method furthermore promising. In this review, we discuss the development of the PPTT method with special emphasis on the recent in vitro and in vivo success using gold nanospheres coupled with visible lasers and gold nanorods and silica-gold nanoshells coupled with near-infrared lasers.},

By measuring the modification of the radiative rate of the chromophores at different cavity lengths, we extract the quantum yield of CdSe/ZnS semiconductor nanocrystals emitting at three different wavelengths and excited by a single wavelength in the multicolor solution. Using several detection channels, we show that only one measurement is needed for determining the quantum yield values of all the types of chromophores in the sample. The obtained results show a very good agreement with the values commonly observed using other techniques. The nanocavity-based method opens up new opportunities of determining fluorescence quantum yields in complex systems and can be used for a big variety of fluorescence studies where multichromophore samples are involved.},

abstract = {We demonstrate controlled trapping and manipulation of single silver (Ag) nanowires in two dimensions at a surface using structured light fields generated with a spatial light modulator. The Ag nanowires are attracted toward the regions of maximal optical intensity along the surface when the trapping laser light is linearly polarized and are repelled toward the minima of optical intensity when the light is circularly polarized. For linearly polarized light, stably trapped nanowires are oriented perpendicular to the polarization direction due to a torque induced by an asymmetrical response of the nanowire to the electric field. The attractive interactions with linearly polarized trapping laser light, which is at 800 nm for all measurements, enable stable trapping and translation of Ag nanowires in the antinodes of optical gratings and in zero-order Bessel beams. Trapped nanowires can be positioned and oriented on a transparent dielectric substrate, making possible the nonmechanical assembly of plasmonic nanostructures for particular functions.},

abstract = {We constructed a next-generation optical trapping instrument to study the motility of single motor proteins, such as kinesin moving along a microtubule. The instrument can be operated as a two-dimensional force clamp, applying loads of fixed magnitude and direction to motor-coated microscopic beads moving in vitro. Flexibility and automation in experimental design are achieved by computer control of both the trap position, via acousto-optic deflectors, and the sample position, using a three-dimensional piezo stage. Each measurement is preceded by an initialization sequence, which includes adjustment of bead height relative to the coverslip using a variant of optical force microscopy (to +/-4 nm), a two-dimensional raster scan to calibrate position detector response, and adjustment of bead lateral position relative to the microtubule substrate (to +/-3 nm). During motor-driven movement, both the trap and stage are moved dynamically to apply constant force while keeping the trapped bead within the calibrated range of the detector. We present details of force clamp operation and preliminary data showing kinesin motor movement subject to diagonal and forward loads.},

Achieving spatial resolutions of 20-40nm or better in both fixed and living cells, these methods are currently being established as powerful tools for minimally-invasive spatiotemporal analysis of structural details in cellular processes which benefit from enhanced resolution. Briefly covering the basic principles, this short review then summarizes key recent developments and application examples of two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) multi-color techniques and faster time-lapse schemes. The prospects for quantitative imaging - in terms of improved ability to correct for dipole-emission-induced systematic localization errors and to provide accurate counts of molecular copy numbers within nanoscale cellular domains - are discussed.},

abstract = {Predictive models are beneficial tools for researchers to use in prioritizing nanoparticles (NPs) for toxicological tests, but experimental evaluation can be time-consuming and expensive, and thus, priority should be given to tests that identify the NPs most likely to be harmful. For characterization of NPs, the physical binding of NPs to DNA molecules is important to measure, as interference with DNA function may be one cause of toxicity. Here, we determined the interaction energy between 12 types of NPs and DNA based on the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) model and then predicted the affinity of the NPs for DNA. Using the single-molecule imaging technique known as atomic force microscopy (AFM), we experimentally determined the binding affinity of those NPs for DNA. Theoretical predictions and experimental observations of the binding affinity agreed well. Furthermore, the effect of NPs on DNA replication in vitro was investigated with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The results showed that NPs with a high affinity for DNA strongly inhibited DNA replication, whereas NPs with low affinity had no or minimal effects on DNA replication. The methodology here is expected to benefit the genotoxicological testing of NPs as well as the design of safe NPs.},

@article{Engel2007,
abstract = {Photosynthetic complexes are exquisitely tuned to capture solar light efficiently, and then transmit the excitation energy to reaction centres, where long term energy storage is initiated. The energy transfer mechanism is often described by semiclassical models that invoke 'hopping' of excited-state populations along discrete energy levels. Two-dimensional Fourier transform electronic spectroscopy has mapped these energy levels and their coupling in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) bacteriochlorophyll complex, which is found in green sulphur bacteria and acts as an energy 'wire' connecting a large peripheral light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, to the reaction centre. The spectroscopic data clearly document the dependence of the dominant energy transport pathways on the spatial properties of the excited-state wavefunctions of the whole bacteriochlorophyll complex. But the intricate dynamics of quantum coherence, which has no classical analogue, was largely neglected in the analyses-even though electronic energy transfer involving oscillatory populations of donors and acceptors was first discussed more than 70 years ago, and electronic quantum beats arising from quantum coherence in photosynthetic complexes have been predicted and indirectly observed. Here we extend previous two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy investigations of the FMO bacteriochlorophyll complex, and obtain direct evidence for remarkably long-lived electronic quantum coherence playing an important part in energy transfer processes within this system. The quantum coherence manifests itself in characteristic, directly observable quantum beating signals among the excitons within the Chlorobium tepidum FMO complex at 77 K. This wavelike characteristic of the energy transfer within the photosynthetic complex can explain its extreme efficiency, in that it allows the complexes to sample vast areas of phase space to find the most efficient path.},

From kinetics studies, we show 3 orders of magnitude increase in nanorod growth rate when the temperature is raised from room temperature to 97 degrees C.

abstract = {Optical nanoantennas confine light on the nanoscale, enabling strong light-matter interactions and ultracompact optical devices. Such confined nanovolumes of light have nonzero field components in all directions (x, y, and z). Unfortunately mapping of the actual nanoscale field vectors has so far remained elusive, though antenna hotspots have been explored by several techniques. In this paper, we present a novel method to probe all three components of the local antenna field. To this end a resonant nanoantenna is fabricated at the vertex of a scanning tip. Next, the nanoantenna is deterministically scanned in close proximity to single fluorescent molecules, whose fixed excitation dipole moment reads out the local field vector. With nanometer molecular resolution, we distinctly map x-, y-, and z-field components of the dipole antenna, i.e. a full vectorial mode map, and show good agreement with full 3D FDTD simulations. Moreover, the fluorescence polarization maps the localized coupling, with emission through the longitudinal antenna mode. Finally, the resonant antenna probe is used for single molecule imaging with 40 nm fwhm response function. The total fluorescence enhancement is 7.6 times, while out-of-plane molecules, almost undetectable in far-field, are made visible by the strong antenna z-field with a fluorescence enhancement up to 100 times. Interestingly, the apparent position of molecules shifts up to 20 nm depending on their orientation. The capability to resolve orientational information on the single molecule level makes the scanning resonant antenna an ideal tool for extreme resolution bioimaging.},

abstract = {A hyperspectral imaging method was developed that allowed the identification of heterogeneous plasmon response from 50 nm diameter gold colloidal particles on a conducting substrate in a transparent three-electrode spectroelectrochemical cell under non-Faradaic conditions. At cathodic potentials, we identified three distinct behaviors from different nanoparticles within the same sample: irreversible chemical reactions, reversible chemical reactions, and reversible charge density tuning. The irreversible reactions in particular would be difficult to discern in alternate methodologies. Additional heterogeneity was observed when single nanoparticles demonstrating reversible charge density tuning in the cathodic regime were measured dynamically in anodic potential ranges. Some nanoparticles that showed charge density tuning in the cathodic range also showed signs of an additional chemical tuning mechanism in the anodic range. The expected changes in nanoparticle free-electron density were modeled using a charge density-modified Drude dielectric function and Mie theory, a commonly used model in colloidal spectroelectrochemistry. Inconsistencies between experimental results and predictions of this common physical model were identified and highlighted. The broad range of responses on even a simple sample highlights the rich experimental and theoretical playgrounds that hyperspectral single-particle electrochemistry opens.},

Here, we demonstrate that room-temperature SPASER emission can be achieved by amplifying longitudinal surface plasmon modes supported in gold nanorods as plasmon nanocavities and utilizing laser dyes to supply optical gain for compensation of plasmon losses. By choosing a particular organic dye and adjusting the doping level, the resonant wavelength of the SPASER emission can be tuned from 562 to 627 nm with a spectral line width narrowed down to 5-11 nm.

Heat generation can be beneficial or detrimental for a given system or technique, but in either case it is useful to have knowledge of local temperatures. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), potentially down to the limit of single-molecule (SM) detection, has been suggested as a viable route for measuring nanoscale temperatures through simultaneous collection of Stokes and anti-Stokes SER scattering, as the ratio of their intensities is related to the Boltzmann distribution. We have rigorously verified SM detection in anti-Stokes SERS of rhodamine 6G on aggregated Ag nanoparticles using the isotopologue method.

However, while the number of nanoparticle types and applications continues to increase, studies to characterize their effects after exposure and to address their potential toxicity are few in comparison. In the medical field in particular, nanoparticles are being utilized in diagnostic and therapeutic tools to better understand, detect, and treat human diseases. Exposure to nanoparticles for medical purposes involves intentional contact or administration; therefore, understanding the properties of nanoparticles and their effect on the body is crucial before clinical use can occur. This Review presents a summary of the in vitro cytotoxicity data currently available on three classes of nanoparticles. With each of these nanoparticles, different data has been published about their cytotoxicity due to varying experimental conditions as well as differing nanoparticle physiochemical properties. For nanoparticles to move into the clinical arena, it is important that nanotoxicology research uncovers and understands how these multiple factors influence the toxicity of nanoparticles so that their undesirable properties can be avoided. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH a Co.

abstract = {Back-focal-plane interferometry is used to measure displacements of optically trapped samples with very high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the technique is closely related to a method that measures the rate of change in light momentum. It has long been known that displacements of the interference pattern at the back focal plane may be used to track the optical force directly, provided that a considerable fraction of the light is effectively monitored. Nonetheless, the practical application of this idea has been limited to counter-propagating, low-aperture beams where the accurate momentum measurements are possible. Here, we experimentally show that the connection can be extended to single-beam optical traps. In particular, we show that, in a gradient trap, the calibration product $\kappa$ {\textperiodcentered} $\beta$ (where $\kappa$ is the trap stiffness and 1/$\beta$ is the position sensitivity) corresponds to the factor that converts detector signals into momentum changes; this factor is uniquely determined by three construction features of the detection instrument and does not depend, therefore, on the specific conditions of the experiment. Then, we find that force measurements obtained from back-focal-plane displacements are in practice not restricted to a linear relationship with position and hence they can be extended outside that regime. Finally, and more importantly, we show that these properties are still recognizable even when the system is not fully optimized for light collection. These results should enable a more general use of back-focal-plane interferometry whenever the ultimate goal is the measurement of the forces exerted by an optical trap.},

While background free luminescence and scattering spectroscopy is widely used, recording the absorption spectrum only is rather difficult. Here we present an approach capable of recording pure absorption spectra of individual nanostructures. We demonstrate the implementation of single-particle absorption spectroscopy on strongly scattering plasmonic nanoparticles by combining photothermal microscopy with a supercontinuum laser and an innovative calibration procedure that accounts for chromatic aberrations and wavelength-dependent excitation powers. Comparison of the absorption spectra to the scattering spectra of the same individual gold nanoparticles reveals the blueshift of the absorption spectra, as predicted by Mie theory but previously not detectable in extinction measurements that measure the sum of absorption and scattering. By covering a wavelength range of 300 nm, we are furthermore able to record absorption spectra of single gold nanorods with different aspect ratios. We find that the spectral shift between absorption and scattering for the longitudinal plasmon resonance decreases as a function of nanorod aspect ratio, in agreement with simulations.},

A rat esophagoduodenal anastomosis model was used for the in vivo ablation study, and three human esophageal cell lines were used to study the response of cancer cells and benign cells to near infrared light after treatment with CS-GGS. The results indicate that both cancerous tissue and cancer cells took up more gold nanoparticles and were completely ablated after exposure to near infrared light. The benign tissue and noncancerous cells showed less uptake of these nanoparticles, and remained viable after exposure to near infrared light. CS-GGS nanoparticles could provide an optimal endoluminal therapeutic option for near infrared light ablation of esophageal cancer.},

abstract = {Inorganic carbon nanomaterials, also called carbon nanodots, exhibit a strong photoluminescence with unusual properties and, thus, have been the focus of intense research. Nonetheless, the origin of their photoluminescence is still unclear and the subject of scientific debates. Here, we present a single particle comprehensive study of carbon nanodot photoluminescence, which combines emission and lifetime spectroscopy, defocused emission dipole imaging, azimuthally polarized excitation dipole scanning, nanocavity-based quantum yield measurements, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. We find that photoluminescent carbon nanodots behave as electric dipoles, both in absorption and emission, and that their emission originates from the recombination of photogenerated charges on defect centers involving a strong coupling between the electronic transition and collective vibrations of the lattice structure.},

However, there is a lack of such nanostructures for the mid-visible spectral regions as most available chemically stable nanostructures offer high sensitivity in red to far red spectrum. In this work, we report the assembly of highly sensitive nanoparticle structures using a hydroxylamine mediated core-satellite assembly of 20 nm gold nanoparticle satellites onto 60 nm spherical gold cores. The average number of satellites allows tuning the plasmon resonance wavelength from 543 to 575 nm. The core-satellite nanostructures are stable in pH ranges from 5 to 9 and show about two-fold higher plasmonic sensitivity than similar sized gold nanospheres.},

abstract = {Plasmonic dark modes are pure near-field modes that can arise from the plasmon hybridization in a set of interacting nanoparticles. When compared to bright modes, dark modes have longer lifetimes due to their lack of a net dipole moment, making them attractive for a number of applications. We demonstrate the excitation and optical detection of a collective dark plasmonic mode from individual plasmonic trimers. The trimers consist of triangular arrangements of gold nanorods, and due to this symmetry, the lowest-energy dark plasmonic mode can interact with radially polarized light. The experimental data presented confirm the excitation of this mode, and its assignment is supported with an electrostatic approximation wherein these dark modes are described in terms of plasmon hybridization. The strong confinement of energy in these modes and their associated near fields hold great promise for achieving strong coupling to single photon emitters.},

There currently exist several approaches to control the immobilization of nano-objects but they all involve a cumbersome delivery step and require prior knowledge of the hot spot location. Herein, we present a novel technique in which the enhanced local field in the hot spot is the driving mechanism which triggers the binding of proteins via three-photon absorption. This way, we demonstrate exclusive immobilization of nanoscale amounts of BSA molecules into the nanometer-sized gap of plasmonic dimers. The immobilized proteins can then act as a scaffold to subsequently attach an additional nanoscale object such as a molecule or a nanocrystal. This universal technique is envisioned to benefit a wide range of nano-optical functionalities including biosensing, enhanced spectroscopy like SERS or SEIRA as well as quantum optics.},

We observe a gradual shape change from a long and thin rod to a shorter and wider rod, which eventually collapses into a sphere when enough laser energy is deposited.

For each AuNR, an aspect ratio-independent transverse plasmon resonance (TSPR) was detected at 2.41 eV. Aspect-ratio-dependent longitudinal surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) were observed at 2.08 ± 0.19 eV, 1.76 ± 0.12 eV, and 1.53 ± 0.15 eV for the 1.86-AR, 2.91-AR, and 3.90-AR samples, respectively. On the basis of both excitation and emission polarization-resolved two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) measurements, AuNR PL emission proceeded by plasmon-mediated radiative electron?hole recombination. The resonant LSPR mode frequencies of the nanorods were determined from interferometrically detected TPPL signals. For these measurements, the interpulse time delays of a spectrally broad laser pulse (1.48?1.65 eV) were changed systematically with attosecond time resolution, and the TPPL signal amplitude was recorded. The 1.86-AR AuNR did not support a plasmon mode that was resonant within the laser bandwidth, whereas the 2.91-AR and 3.90-AR samples had LSPR frequencies that overlapped the high- and low-energy components of the excitation pulse. The LSPR frequencies were obtained by Fourier transformation of the time-domain TPPL data and compared to dark-field scattering spectra. The accuracy of the interferometric TPPL measurement for recovering plasmon resonance frequencies was confirmed by polarization-dependent measurements; alignment of the laser electric field parallel to the nanorod major axis was LSPR resonant, whereas projection of the laser pulse into an orthogonal plane was not. Finally, dephasing times (T2) for resonant plasmon modes were extracted from analysis of interferometric TPPL and second harmonic generation data. These results showed that the dephasing time increased from 22 ± 4 to 31 ± 9 fs as the LSPR resonance energy decreased from 1.76 to 1.53 eV, as a result of less efficient plasmon dephasing due to interband scattering for lower energy resonances. These results demonstrate the capability of interferometric nonlinear optical imaging with single-nanostructure sensitivity for determining structure-specific dephasing times, which influence the efficiency of metal nanoparticle light-harvesting applications.

Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis revealed that the Pc macrocycle was present on the gold surface and also that the TOAB phase transfer reagent, used during the synthesis, was associated with the nanoparticles. The three-component (photosensitizer/gold/phase transfer reagent) nanoparticles were shown to generate singlet oxygen with enhanced quantum yields as compared to the free Pc. Additionally, the association of the transfer reagent promoted the solubility of the surface-bound hydrophobic sensitizer in polar solventswhichwouldfacilitate their systemic injection. The results suggest that these three-component structures have potential as a useful vehicle for the delivery of photosensitizer agents in photodynamic therapy.},

A requirement for an object to behave as a black body is to perfectly absorb light of all wavelengths. This important feature has not been observed for real materials because materials intrinsically have specific absorption bands because of their structure and composition. We found a material that can absorb light almost perfectly across a very wide spectral range (0.2-200 mum). We attribute this black body behavior to stem from the sparseness and imperfect alignment of the vertical single-walled carbon nanotubes.},

In order to exploit them in nanoscale devices, flexible methods are needed for the controlled integration of nanoparticles on surfaces with few-nanometer precision. Current technologies usually involve a combination of molecular self-assembly with surface patterning by diverse lithographic methods like UV, dip-pen, or microcontact printing.(1,2) Here we demonstrate the direct laser printing of individual colloidal nanoparticles by using optical forces for positioning and the van der Waals attraction for binding them to the substrate. As a proof-of-concept, we print single spherical gold nanoparticles with a positioning precision of 50 nm. By analyzing the printing mechanism, we identify the key physical parameters controlling the method, which has the potential for the production of nanoscale devices and circuits with distinct nanoparticles.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the size-dependent penetration ability of gold nanoparticles and the potential application of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles for intranucleus delivery and therapy. We synthesized gold nanoparticles with diameters of 2, 6, 10, and 16 nm and compared their intracellular distribution in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm (2 and 6 nm) could enter the nucleus, whereas larger ones (10 and 16 nm) were found only in the cytoplasm. We then investigated the possibility of using ultrasmall 2 nm nanoparticles as carriers for nuclear delivery of a triplex-forming oligonucleotide (TFO) that binds to the c-myc promoter. Compared to free TFO, the nanoparticle-conjugated TFO was more effective at reducing c-myc RNA and c-myc protein, which resulted in reduced cell viability. Our result demonstrated that the entry of gold nanoparticles into the cell nucleus is critically dependent on the size of the nanoparticles. We developed a strategy for regulating gene expression, by directly delivering TFOs into the nucleus using ultrasmall gold nanoparticles. More importantly, guidelines were provided to choose appropriate nanocarriers for different biomedical purposes.},

abstract = {The synergy of self- and directed-assembly processes and lithography provides intriguing avenues to fabricate translationally ordered nanoparticle arrangements, but currently lacks the robustness necessary to deliver complex spatial organization. Here, we demonstrate that interparticle spacing and local orientation of gold nanorods (AuNR) can be tuned by controlling the Debye length of AuNR in solution and the dimensions of a chemical contrast pattern. Electrostatic and hydrophobic selectivity for AuNR to absorb to patterned regions of poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) and polystyrene brushes and mats was demonstrated for AuNR functionalized with mercaptopropane sulfonate (MS) and poly(ethylene glycol), respectively. For P2VP patterns of stripes with widths comparable to the length of the AuNR, single- and double-column arrangements of AuNR oriented parallel and perpendicular to the P2VP line were obtained for MS-AuNR. Furthermore, the spacing of the assembled AuNR was uniform along the stripe and related to the ionic strength of the AuNR dispersion. The different AuNR arrangements are consistent with predictions based on maximization of packing of AuNR within the confined strip.},

The study comprises the influence of the trapping laser wavelength, the angular aperture of focusing optics, the orientation of the ellipsoidal nanorod, and the aspect ratio of its principal axes. The results reveal a significantly different behavior of the nanorod if the trapping wavelength is longer or shorter than the wavelength corresponding to the longitudinal plasmon resonance mode.

abstract = {The use of surface plasmons, charge density oscillations of conduction electrons of metallic nanostructures, to boost the efficiency of light-harvesting devices through increased light-matter interactions could drastically alter how sunlight is converted into electricity or fuels. These excitations can decay directly into energetic electron–hole pairs, useful for photocurrent generation or photocatalysis. However, the mechanisms behind plasmonic carrier generation remain poorly understood. Here we use nanowire-based hot-carrier devices on a wide-bandgap semiconductor to show that plasmonic carrier generation is proportional to internal field-intensity enhancement and occurs independently of bulk absorption. We also show that plasmon-induced hot electrons have higher energies than carriers generated by direct excitation and that reducing the barrier height allows for the collection of carriers from plasmons and direct photoexcitation. Our results provide a route to increasing the efficiency of plasmonic hot-carrier devices, which could lead to more efficient devices for converting sunlight into usable energy.},

abstract = {Protein families with functionally diverse members can illuminate the structural determinants of protein function and the process by which protein structure and function evolve. To identify the key amino acid changes that differentiate one family member from another, most studies have taken a horizontal approach, swapping candidate residues between present-day family members. This approach has often been stymied, however, by the fact that shifts in function often require multiple interacting mutations; chimeric proteins are often nonfunctional, either because one lineage has amassed mutations that are incompatible with key residues that conferred a new function on other lineages, or because it lacks mutations required to support those key residues. These difficulties can be overcome by using a vertical strategy, which reconstructs ancestral genes and uses them as the appropriate background in which to study the effects of historical mutations on functional diversification. In this review, we discuss the advantages of the vertical strategy and highlight several exemplary studies that have used ancestral gene reconstruction to reveal the molecular underpinnings of protein structure, function, and evolution.},

Activation occurs by rapid one-step cleavage of glutamate with $\gamma$-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), which is not expressed in normal tissue, but is overexpressed on the cell membrane of various cancer cells, thus leading to complete uncaging and dequenching of the fluorescence probe. In vitro activation of gGlu-HMRG was evident in 11 human ovarian cancer cell lines tested. In vivo in mouse models of disseminated human peritoneal ovarian cancer, activation of gGlu-HMRG occurred within 1 min of topically spraying the tumor, creating high signal contrast between the tumor and the background. The gGlu-HMRG probe is practical for clinical application during surgical or endoscopic procedures because of its rapid and strong activation upon contact with GGT on the surface of cancer cells.},

@article{Collini2010,
abstract = {Photosynthesis makes use of sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into useful biomass and is vital for life on Earth. Crucial components for the photosynthetic process are antenna proteins, which absorb light and transmit the resultant excitation energy between molecules to a reaction centre. The efficiency of these electronic energy transfers has inspired much work on antenna proteins isolated from photosynthetic organisms to uncover the basic mechanisms at play. Intriguingly, recent work has documented that light-absorbing molecules in some photosynthetic proteins capture and transfer energy according to quantum-mechanical probability laws instead of classical laws at temperatures up to 180 K. This contrasts with the long-held view that long-range quantum coherence between molecules cannot be sustained in complex biological systems, even at low temperatures. Here we present two-dimensional photon echo spectroscopy measurements on two evolutionarily related light-harvesting proteins isolated from marine cryptophyte algae, which reveal exceptionally long-lasting excitation oscillations with distinct correlations and anti-correlations even at ambient temperature. These observations provide compelling evidence for quantum-coherent sharing of electronic excitation across the 5-nm-wide proteins under biologically relevant conditions, suggesting that distant molecules within the photosynthetic proteins are 'wired' together by quantum coherence for more efficient light-harvesting in cryptophyte marine algae.},

This process becomes strongly enhanced under plasmon resonance and also depends on the shape and organization of the nanoparticles.

Metal nanoparticles may induce phase transformations when they are in thermal contact with a polymer or a solid matrix, such as ice.

abstract = {A pulsed laser light illumination system was attached to a high-voltage electron microscope (HVEM) for in situ observation of light-induced behaviors of nano objects. The wavelength $\lambda$ of emitted laser pulses was 1064, 532 or 266 nm, and the pulse duration was 6-8 ns. Using this combined HVEM system, we observed the deformation behavior of gold nanorods irradiated by a pulsed laser ($\lambda$ = 1064 nm) at an intensity of 310 J m(-2) pulse or higher. A single shot of pulsed laser reduced the aspect ratio of the gold nanorods from 5 to a much smaller value. The extent of the reduction increased at higher laser intensities. However, at 310 J m(-2) pulse(-1), additional pulsed shots induced limited further deformation. The mean aspect ratio approximated to 2.5 even after irradiation with 7 pulses (total fluence exceeding 2 MJ m(-2)). In situ high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation revealed that deformation was accompanied by total atomic restructuring of the nanorod interiors.},

The lac operon of the bacterium Escherichia coli has been a model for quantifying the physiological impact of costly protein production and for elucidating the resulting regulatory mechanisms. We report quantitative fitness measurements in 27 redesigned operons that suggested that protein production is not the primary origin of fitness costs. Instead, we discovered that the lac permease activity, which relates linearly to cost, is the major physiological burden to the cell. These findings explain control points in the lac operon that minimize the cost of lac permease activity, not protein expression. Characterizing similar relationships in other systems will be important to map the impact of cost/benefit tradeoffs on cell physiology and regulation.},

abstract = {We introduce a method whereby the electromagnetic field that governs the force on a Rayleigh particle can be tailored such that the resultant force field conforms to a desired geometry. The electromagnetic field is expanded as a set of vector spherical wavefunctions (VSWFs) that describe the field over all space. Given the incident field, the resultant force on a given Rayleigh particle can be calculated throughout a volume of interest. We use an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to search the space of coefficients governing the VSWFs for those that produce the desired force field. We demonstrate how Maxwell's equations will support an "optical tunnel" that guides particles to a trap location while at the same time preventing particles outside the tunnel from approaching the trap. This result is of interest because the field is impressed throughout the domain; that is to say, once the field is generated, no additional control is required to guide the particles.},

abstract = {Understanding the atomic diffusions at the nanoscale is important for controlling the synthesis and utilization of nanomaterials. Here, using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations, we demonstrate a so far unexplored unidirectional diffusion from the Au shell to the Cu core in thermally alloying Cu@Au core@shell architecture of ca. 7.1 nm. The initial diffusion step at 423 K is found to be characterized by the formation of a diffusion layer composed of a Au-dilute substitutional CuAu-like intermetallic compound with short Cu-Au bond length (2.61 {\AA}). The diffusion further happens by the migration of the Au atoms with large disorder into the interior Cu matrix at higher temperatures (453 and 553 K). These results suggest that the structural preference of a CuAu-like compound, along with the nanosized effect, plays a critical role in determining the atomic diffusion dynamics.},

abstract = {We show the suppression of luminescence quenching by metal nanoparticles (MNPs) in the plasmon enhancement of luminescence via fast sensitized energy transfer in Mn-doped quantum dots (QDs). The rapid intraparticle energy transfer between exciton and Mn, occurring on a few picoseconds time scale, separates the absorber (exciton) from the emitter (Mn), whose emission is detuned far from the plasmon of the MNP. The rapid temporal separation of the absorber and emitter combined with the reduced spectral overlap between Mn and plasmonic MNP suppresses the quenching of the luminescence while taking advantage of the plasmon-enhanced excitation. We compared the plasmon enhancement of exciton and Mn luminescence intensities in undoped and doped QDs simultaneously as a function of the distance between MNP and QD layers in a multilayer structure to examine the expected advantage of the reduced quenching in the sensitized luminescence. At the optimum MNP-QD layer distance, Mn luminescence exhibits stronger net enhancement than that of the exciton, which can be explained with a model incorporating fast sensitization along with reduced emitter-MNP spectral overlap. This study demonstrates that materials exhibiting fast sensitized luminescence that is sufficiently red-shifted from that of the sensitizer can be superior to usual luminophores in harvesting plasmon enhancement of luminescence by suppressing quenching.},

The two components of the optical force, the gradient force and the scattering force, are determined separately. Both the arbitrary incident field and the scatterer are represented by plane-wave spectra. The scattering force is determined by means of the momentum transfer in either single- or double-scattering processes. Therefore the second-order Born series is evaluated and solved in the frequency domain by Ewald constructions. Numerical results of our two-force-component approach and an established calculation method are compared and show satisfying agreement. Our procedure is applied to investigate axial trapping by focused waves experiencing effects of aperture illumination and refractive-index mismatch.},

We describe the electron dynamics through a master equation incorporating transition rates for optical excitations and electron–electron collisions that are calculated using the screened interaction within an independent-electron picture. Upon optical excitation of the particle by a light pulse, a nonthermal electron distribution is produced, which takes 10s fs to thermalize at an elevated electron temperature due to electron–electron collisions and eventually relaxes back to ambient temperature via coupling to phonons and thermal diffusion. Phonons and diffusion are introduced through a phenomenological inelastic attenuation rate. We find the temporal evolution of the electron energy distribution t...},

abstract = {Interaction of charge carriers with the surface of semiconductor nanocrystals plays an integral role in determining the ultimate fate of the excited state. The surface contains a dynamic ensemble of trap states that can localize excited charges, preventing radiative recombination and reducing fluorescence quantum yields. Here we report quasi-type-II band alignment in graded alloy CdSxSe1-x nanocrystals revealed by femtosecond fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy. Graded alloy CdSxSe1-x quantum dots are a compositionally inhomogeneous nano-heterostructure designed to decouple the exciton from the nanocrystal surface. The large valence band offset between the CdSe-rich core and CdS-rich shell separates the excited hole from the surface by confining it to the core of the nanocrystal. The small conduction band offset, however, allows the electron to delocalize throughout the entire nanocrystal and maintain overlap with the surface. Indeed, the ultrafast charge carrier dynamics reveal that the fast 1-3 ps hole-trapping process is fully eliminated with increasing sulfur composition and the decay constant for electron trapping (∼20-25 ps) shows a slight increase. These findings demonstrate progress toward highly efficient nanocrystal fluorophores that are independent of their surface chemistry to ultimately enable their incorporation into a diverse range of applications without experiencing adverse effects arising from dissimilar environments.},

As an initial step toward achieving this goal, we probed the ability of a collection of {\textgreater}10(6) de novo designed proteins to provide biological functions necessary to sustain cell growth. Our collection of proteins was drawn from a combinatorial library of 102-residue sequences, designed by binary patterning of polar and nonpolar residues to fold into stable 4-helix bundles. We probed the capacity of proteins from this library to function in vivo by testing their abilities to rescue 27 different knockout strains of Escherichia coli, each deleted for a conditionally essential gene. Four different strains--$\Delta$serB, $\Delta$gltA, $\Delta$ilvA, and $\Delta$fes--were rescued by specific sequences from our library. Further experiments demonstrated that a strain simultaneously deleted for all four genes was rescued by co-expression of four novel sequences. Thus, cells deleted for ∼0.1{\%} of the E. coli genome (and ∼1{\%} of the genes required for growth under nutrient-poor conditions) can be sustained by sequences designed de novo.},

The approach can directly convert as-prepared hydrophobic UCNPs into water-soluble DNA-UCNPs without any chemical modification of UCNPs or oligonucleotides. Furthermore, DNA molecules on the DNA-UCNPs retain their biorecognition ability, allowing programmable assembly of hybrid nanostructures. More importantly, we show that these DNA-UCNPs are capable of crossing cell membranes without the need of transfection agents, and their use as agents for bioimaging and DNA delivery are also demonstrated. Finally, DNA aptamer-conjugated UCNPs can be readily used for targeted imaging of cancer cells.},

However, a detailed theoretical description of plasmonic hot-carrier generation in real materials has remained incomplete. Here we report predictions for the prompt distributions of excited 'hot' electrons and holes generated by plasmon decay, before inelastic relaxation, using a quantized plasmon model with detailed electronic structure. We find that carrier energy distributions are sensitive to the electronic band structure of the metal: gold and copper produce holes hotter than electrons by 1-2 eV, while silver and aluminium distribute energies more equitably between electrons and holes. Momentum-direction distributions for hot carriers are anisotropic, dominated by the plasmon polarization for aluminium and by the crystal orientation for noble metals. We show that in thin metallic films intraband transitions can alter the carrier distributions, producing hotter electrons in gold, but interband transitions remain dominant.},

As expected, the stiffness increases linearly with laser power. This is comparable to the stiffness obtained for conventional optical traps for trapping, but for ten times smaller dielectric particles and less power. This approach will allow us to quantitatively evaluate future aperture-based optical traps, with the goal of studying the folding dynamics of smaller proteins (∼ 10 kDa) and small-molecule interactions.},

The labeling signals are specific for intended targets and more photostable than comparable organic dyes, rhodamine B. Using AuNRs with different excitation wavelength, we simultaneously detect one cellular target with different labeling colors. Furthermore, AuNRs-labeled red and AuNRs-labeled green came from the same cellular targets are observed with different filter sets.

Here we provide methodology for visualization of the motion of individual fluorescent molecules. It is applied to imaging of the diffusional path of single molecules in a phospholipid membrane by using phospholipids carrying one rhodamine dye molecule. For this methodology, fluorescence microscopy was carried to a sensitivity so that single fluorescent molecules illuminated for only 5 ms were resolvable at a signal/noise ratio of 28. Repeated illuminations permitted direct observation of the diffusional motion of individual molecules with a positional accuracy of 30 nm. Such capability has fascinating potentials in bioscience--for example, to correlate biological functions of cell membranes with movements, spatial organization, and stoichiometries of individual components.},

abstract = {In this article, we reported an efficient method for eliminating the optical trapping effect on characterization of nanoparticle diffusion parameters by resonance light scattering correlation spectroscopy (RLSCS). The RLSCS was a new single nanoparticle method and its principle was based on measuring the resonance light scattering fluctuations in a highly-focused laser beam due to the Brownian motion of single nanoparticle such as gold nanoparticles (GNPs), which resembled to fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). In RLSCS analysis, the polarizability of nanoparticles are much higher than fluorescent molecules in FCS and the sizes of them are larger, so the optical trapping force significantly affects the diffusion behaviors of nanoparticles under a highly focused laser beam. In this study, we used the 632.8 nm He-Ne laser as the light source, which was close to the resonance scattering band of GNPs, and chose GNPs (from 20 nm to 100 nm) as model samples. We theoretically and experimentally investigated the optical trapping effect of GNPs in RLSCS, and observed a good linear relation between the characteristic diffusion times of GNPs and laser intensity in the certain condition (below 100 ?W). This result was in line with the theoretical deduction. By the extrapolation strategy, we effectively eliminated the optical trapping effect and accurately obtained the diameter of GNPs, which was in good agreement with that obtained by transmission electron microscopy. The method described here can extend to FCS analysis of fluorescent nanoparticles as well.

abstract = {A detailed wavelength-scanned surface-enhanced Raman excitation spectroscopy (WS SERES) study of benzenethiol adsorbed on Ag nanoparticle arrays, fabricated by nanosphere lithography (NSL), is presented. These NSL-derived Ag nanoparticle array surfaces are both structurally well-characterized and extremely uniform in size. The WS SERES spectra are correlated, both spatially and spectrally, with the corresponding localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) spectra of the nanoparticle arrays. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra were measured in two excitation wavelength ranges: (1) 425-505 nm, and (2) 610-800 nm, as well as with the 532-nm line from a solid-state diode-pumped laser. The WS SERES spectra have line shapes similar to those of the LSPR spectra. The maximum SERS enhancement factor is shown to occur for excitation wavelengths that are blue-shifted with respect to the LSPR lambda(max) of adsorbate-covered nanoparticle arrays. Three vibrational modes of benzenethiol (1575, 1081, and 1009 cm(-1)) are studied simultaneously on one substrate, and it is demonstrated that the smaller Raman shifted peak shows a maximum enhancement closer to the LSPR lambda(max) than that of a larger Raman shifted peak. This is in agreement with the predictions of the electromagnetic (EM) enhancement mechanism of SERS. Enhancement factors of up to approximately 10(8) are achieved, which is also in good agreement with our previous SERES studies.},

abstract = {Tailoring the longitudinal surface plasmon wavelengths (LSPWs), scattering, and absorption cross sections of gold nanorods has been demonstrated by combining anisotropic shortening and transverse overgrowth and judiciously choosing starting Au nanorods. Shortening yields Au nanorods with decreasing lengths but a fixed diameter, while overgrowth produces nanorods with increasing diameters but a nearly unchanged length. Two series of Au nanorods with LSPWs varying in the same spectral range but distinct extinction coefficients are thus obtained. The systematic changes in the LSPW and extinction for the two series of Au nanorods are found to be in good agreement with those obtained from Gans theory. Dark-field imaging performed on two representative nanorod samples with similar LSPWs shows that the scattering intensities of the overgrown nanorods are much larger than those of the shortened nanorods. The experimental results are found to be in very good agreement with those obtained from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. FDTD calculations further reveal that the scattering-to-extinction ratio increases linearly as a function of the diameter for Au nanorods with a fixed aspect ratio.},

The results show that the longitudinal plasmon resonance (electron oscillation along the long axis of the rod) broadens as the width of the rods decreases from 14 to 8 nm. This is attributed to electron surface scattering. Analysis of the data using = + /, where is the effective path length of the electrons and is the Fermi velocity, allows us to determine a value for the surface scattering parameter of = 0.3. Larger rods with widths of 19 and 30 nm were also examined. These samples also show spectral broadening, which is attributed to radiation damping. The relative strengths of the surface scattering and radiation damping effects are in excellent agreement with recent work on spherical gold nanoparticles by Sonnichsen ., , 2002, , 077402; and by Berciaud ., , 2005, , 515.},

abstract = {Femtosecond electron thermalization in metals was investigated using transient thermomodulation transmissivity and reflectivity. Studies were performed using a tunable multiple-wavelength femtosecond pump-probe technique in optically thin gold films in the low perturbation limit. An IR pump beam is used to heat the electron distribution and changes in electron temperature are measured with a visible probe beam at the d band to Fermi-surface transition. We show that the subpicosecond optical response of gold is dominated by delayed thermalization of the electron gas. This effect is particularly important far off the spectral peak of the reflectivity or transmissivity changes, permitting a direct and sensitive access to the internal thermalization of the electron gas. Using a simple rate-equation model, line-shape analysis of the transient reflectivity and transmissivity indicates a thermalization time of the order of 500 fs. At energies close to the Fermi surface, longer thermalization times ∼1–2 ps are observed. These results are in agreement with a more sophisticated model based on calculations of the electron-thermalization dynamics by numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation. This model quantitatively describes the measured transient optical response during the full thermalization time of electron gas, of the order of 1.5 ps, and gives new insight into electron thermalization in metals.},

abstract = {We performed polarized fluorescence emission studies of Nile Red (NR) in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA), and poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) at the single molecule (SM) and at the ensemble level to study the in cage movements of the ground-state molecule in polymer films of nanometric thickness at room temperature. Experiments were performed with wide field irradiation. At the ensemble level, the linearly polarized irradiation was used to induce a photoselection by bleaching, which is compensated by rotational diffusion. Both results show an appreciable difference in mobility of NR in the films that is correlated with the different glass-transition temperatures of the films, particularly in PEMA, which displays a clearly distinct behavior between the 200 nm films, representing a rigid environment, and the 25 nm ones, showing much higher mobility. We developed a model of broad application for polarized photobleaching that allows obtaining rotational diffusion coefficients and photobleaching quantum yields in an easy way from ensemble experiments. The parameters obtained from ensemble measurements correlate well with the results from SM experiments.},

The relationship between gene sequence and fitness has tremendous implications for understanding both evolutionary processes and functional constraints on the encoded proteins. Here, we have exploited deep sequencing technology to experimentally determine the fitness of all possible individual point mutants under controlled conditions for a nine-amino acid region of Hsp90. Over the past five decades, limited glimpses into the relationship between gene sequence and function have sparked a long debate regarding the distribution, relative proportion, and evolutionary significance of deleterious, neutral, and advantageous mutations. Our systematic experimental measurement of fitness effects of Hsp90 mutants in yeast, evaluated in the light of existing population genetic theory, are remarkably consistent with a nearly neutral model of molecular evolution.},

Gold nanorods feature a strong plasmon-enhanced two-photon luminescence, can be easily functionalized, and have been shown to be nontoxic. These properties make gold nanorods very suitable for in vivo two-photon luminescence microscopy. By rapid multifocal scanning, we combine the advantages of 3D molecular tracking methods using wide-field imaging with the advantages of two-photon microscopy. Isolated gold nanorods can be localized with a resolution of 4 nm in the xy-plane and 8 nm in the z-direction. The polarization-dependence of the two-photon luminescence signal can be used to resolve the angular orientation, even when two gold nanorods are separated by less than the diffraction limit. Individual nanorods in live U2OS cells could be followed in 3 dimensions for over 30 min, with a photon noise limited accuracy, and a time resolution of 50 ms in 2D and 500 ms in 3D.},

@article{Belkin2013,
abstract = {Practical applications of solid-state nanopores for DNA detection and sequencing require the electrophoretic motion of DNA through the nanopores to be precisely controlled. Controlling the motion of single-stranded DNA presents a particular challenge, in part because of the multitude of conformations that a DNA strand can adopt in a nanopore. Through continuum, coarse-grained and atomistic modeling, we demonstrate that local heating of the nanopore volume can be used to alter the electrophoretic mobility and conformation of single-stranded DNA. In the nanopore systems considered, the temperature near the nanopore is modulated via a nanometer-size heater element that can be radiatively switched on and off. The local enhancement of temperature produces considerable stretching of the DNA fragment confined within the nanopore. Such stretching is reversible, so that the conformation of DNA can be toggled between compact (local heating is off) and extended (local heating is on) states. The effective thermophoretic force acting on single-stranded DNA in the vicinity of the nanopore is found to be sufficiently large (4-8 pN) to affect such changes in the DNA conformation. The local heating of the nanopore volume is observed to promote single-file translocation of DNA strands at transmembrane biases as low as 10 mV, which opens new avenues for using solid-state nanopores for detection and sequencing of DNA.},

abstract = {This article provides an overview of current research into the synthesis and properties of gold nanorods. Interest in rod-shaped nanoparticles stems from their unique optical properties, which can be approximated by Mie–Gans theory. We begin by outlining briefly the origin of the shape-dependent optical properties of rods. The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties. Initial results on the optical properties of such nanocomposites are reviewed. This review is concluded with a section devoted to the future perspectives for gold rods as novel materials.},

Recently, the importance of quantifying temperature has been highlighted, as it correlates with biochemical reaction rates. Several methods for detecting intracellular temperature have recently been established. Here we develop a novel method for sensing temperature in living cells based on the imaging technique of fluorescence of quantum dots. We apply the method to quantify the temperature difference in a human derived neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y. Our results show that temperatures in the cell body and neurites are different and thus suggest that inhomogeneous heat production and dissipation happen in a cell. We estimate that heterogeneous heat dissipation results from the characteristic shape of neuronal cells, which consist of several compartments formed with different surface-volume ratios. Inhomogeneous heat production is attributable to the localization of specific organelles as the heat source.},

Upon resonant excitation, plasmonic gold nanoantennas can generate strong two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL). The TPPL from gold is broadband and depolarized, and may serve as an ideal local source for the investigation of antenna eigenmodes. In this work, TPPL spectra of three arrays of single-crystalline gold nanoantennas are comprehensively investigated. We carefully compare the TPPL spectra with dark-field scattering spectra and numerically simulated spectra. We show the modulation effect of the transverse resonant mode and the nonfundamental longitudinal mode on the TPPL spectrum. We also demonstrate suppression of TPPL due to the subradiant antibonding modes and study the influence of antenna resonant modes on the overall TPPL yield. Our work provides direct experimental evidence on nanoantenna-mediated near-to-far-field energy coupling and gains insight into the emission spectrum of the TPPL from gold nanoantennas.},

abstract = {Most therapeutic agents suffer from poor solubility, rapid clearance from the blood stream, a lack of targeting, and often poor translocation ability across cell membranes. Drug/gene delivery systems (DDSs) are capable of overcoming some of these barriers to enhance delivery of drugs to their right place of action, e.g. inside cancer cells. In this review, we focus on nanoparticles as DDSs. Complementary experimental and computational studies have enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of action of nanocarriers and their underlying interactions with drugs, biomembranes and other biological molecules. We review key biophysical aspects of DDSs and discuss how computer modeling can assist in rational design of DDSs with improved and optimized properties. We summarize commonly used experimental techniques for the study of DDSs. Then we review computational studies for several major categories of nanocarriers, including dendrimers and dendrons, polymer-, peptide-, nucleic acid-, lipid-, and carbon-based DDSs, and gold nanoparticles.},

Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies were covalently bound to the nanoparticles via a terminal carboxy moiety on the polyethylene glycol. The nanoparticle conjugates were stable towards aggregation, and under irradiation with visible red light efficiently produced cytotoxic singlet oxygen. Cellular experiments demonstrated that the nanoparticle conjugates selectively target breast cancer cells that overexpress the HER2 epidermal growth factor cell surface receptor, and that they are effective photodynamic therapy agents.},

@article{Yan2013,
abstract = {Understanding whether noble-metal nanostructures can be trapped optically and under what conditions will enable a range of applications that exploit their plasmonic properties. However, there are several nontrivial issues that first need to be resolved. A major one is that metal particles experience strong radiation pressure in optical beams, while stable optical trapping requires an attractive force greater than this radiation pressure. Therefore, it has generally been considered impossible to obtain sufficiently strong gradient forces using single-beam optical tweezers to trap relatively large metal nanostructures in three dimensions. Here we demonstrate that a single, tightly focused laser beam with a wavelength of 800 nm can achieve three-dimensional optical trapping of individual gold (Au) nanowires with lengths over 2 $\mu$m. Nanowires can be trapped by the beam at one of their ends, in which case they undergo significant angular fluctuations due to Brownian motion of the untrapped end. They can also be trapped close to their midpoints, in which case they are oriented approximately perpendicular to the light polarization direction. The behavior is markedly different from that of Ag nanowires with similar length and diameter, which cannot be trapped in three dimensions by a single focused Gaussian beam. Our results, including electrodynamics simulations that help to explain our experimental findings, suggest that the conventional wisdom, which holds that larger metal particles cannot be trapped, needs to be replaced with an understanding based on the details of plasmon resonances in the particles.},

Plasmonic light concentrators can elegantly interface diffraction-limited dielectric optical components with nanophotonic structures. Passive and active plasmonic devices provide new pathways to generate, guide, modulate and detect light with structures that are similar in size to state-of-the-art electronic devices. With the ability to produce highly confined optical fields, the conventional rules for light-matter interactions need to be re-examined, and researchers are venturing into new regimes of optical physics. In this review we will discuss the basic concepts behind plasmonics-enabled light concentration and manipulation, make an attempt to capture the wide range of activities and excitement in this area, and speculate on possible future directions.},

In this paper, numerical studies show that optical tweezers using radial polarization can stably trap metallic particles in 3-dimension. The extremely strong axial component of a highly focused radially polarized beam provides a large gradient force. Meanwhile, this strong axial field component does not contribute to the Poynting vector along the optical axis. Consequently, it does not create axial scattering/absorption forces. Owing to the spatial separation of the gradient force and scattering/absorption forces, a stable 3-D optical trap for metallic particles can be formed.},

Interactions with the actin cytoskeleton have been proposed as a potential mechanism with the control of mobility imparted through transmembrane "pickets" or GPI-anchored lipid nanodomains. This hypothesis is based on observations of molecular mobility using various methods, although many of these lack the spatiotemporal resolution required to fully capture all the details of the interaction dynamics. In addition, the validity of certain experimental approaches, particularly single-particle tracking, has been questioned due to a number of potential experimental artifacts. Here, we use interferometric scattering microscopy to track molecules labeled with 20-40 nm scattering gold beads with simultaneous {\textless}2 nm spatial and 20 $\mu$s temporal precision to investigate the existence and mechanistic origin of anomalous diffusion in bilayer membranes. We use supported lipid bilayers as a model system and demonstrate that the label does not influence time-dependent diffusion in the small particle limit (≤40 nm). By tracking the motion of the ganglioside lipid GM1 bound to the cholera toxin B subunit for different substrates and lipid tail properties, we show that molecular pinning and interleaflet coupling between lipid tail domains on a nanoscopic scale suffice to induce transient immobilization and thereby anomalous subdiffusion on the millisecond time scale.},

abstract = {The cytosolic phosphatase and tensin homolog Pten-kinase PINK1 involved in mitochondrial quality control undergoes a proteolytic process inside mitochondria. It has been suggested that the protein is not fully imported into mitochondria during this maturation. Here, we have established live cell triple-color superresolution microscopy by combining FPALM and tracking and localization microscopy (TALM) in order to unravel the spatiotemporal organization of the C-terminal kinase domain of PINK1 during this process. We find that the kinase domain is imported into active mitochondria and entirely co-localizes with respiratory complex I at the inner mitochondrial membrane. When the processing step inside mitochondria is inhibited or mitochon-dria are de-energized, full length PINK1 distributes between the outer and the inner mitochondrial membranes indicating a holdup of import. These findings give the molecular base for a dual role of PINK1 - inside energized mitochondria and outside of de-energized mitochondria.},

@article{Garces-Chavez2002,
abstract = {Optical tweezers are commonly used for manipulating microscopic particles, with applications in cell manipulation, colloid research, manipulation of micromachines and studies of the properties of light beams. Such tweezers work by the transfer of momentum from a tightly focused laser to the particle, which refracts and scatters the light and distorts the profile of the beam. The forces produced by this process cause the particle to be trapped near the beam focus. Conventional tweezers use gaussian light beams, which cannot trap particles in multiple locations more than a few micrometres apart in the axial direction, because of beam distortion by the particle and subsequent strong divergence from the focal plane. Bessel beams, however, do not diverge and, furthermore, if part of the beam is obstructed or distorted the beam reconstructs itself after a characteristic propagation distance. Here we show how this reconstructive property may be utilized within optical tweezers to trap particles in multiple, spatially separated sample cells with a single beam. Owing to the diffractionless nature of the Bessel beam, secondary trapped particles can reside in a second sample cell far removed ( approximately 3 mm) from the first cell. Such tweezers could be used for the simultaneous study of identically prepared ensembles of colloids and biological matter, and potentially offer enhanced control of 'lab-on-a-chip' and optically driven microstructures.},

This piecewise updating scheme ensures that GMES can adopt OOP without losing its simple structure and time-stepping speed. The users can easily add various material types, sources, and boundary conditions into their code using the Python programming language.

Calculating luminescence spectra based on simplified models of the band structures of the noble metals and taking into account the Fresnel local-field corrections, we find qualitative agreement with the observed spectra from smooth samples. The agreement between theory and experiment is less satisfactory for rough samples. The influence of surface roughness on the luminescence is largely attributable to local-field enhancement in the rough surface protrusions.},

abstract = {Noble-metal nanoparticles have had a substantial impact across a diverse range of fields, including catalysis, sensing, photochemistry, optoelectronics, energy conversion and medicine. Although silver has very desirable physical properties, good relative abundance and low cost, gold nanoparticles have been widely favoured owing to their proved stability and ease of use. Unlike gold, silver is notorious for its susceptibility to oxidation (tarnishing), which has limited the development of important silver-based nanomaterials. Despite two decades of synthetic efforts, silver nanoparticles that are inert or have long-term stability remain unrealized. Here we report a simple synthetic protocol for producing ultrastable silver nanoparticles, yielding a single-sized molecular product in very large quantities with quantitative yield and without the need for size sorting. The stability, purity and yield are substantially better than those for other metal nanoparticles, including gold, owing to an effective stabilization mechanism. The particular size and stoichiometry of the product were found to be insensitive to variations in synthesis parameters. The chemical stability and structural, electronic and optical properties can be understood using first-principles electronic structure theory based on an experimental single-crystal X-ray structure. Although several structures have been determined for protected gold nanoclusters, none has been reported so far for silver nanoparticles. The total structure of a thiolate-protected silver nanocluster reported here uncovers the unique structure of the silver thiolate protecting layer, consisting of Ag2S5 capping structures. The outstanding stability of the nanoparticle is attributed to a closed-shell 18-electron configuration with a large energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, an ultrastable 32-silver-atom excavated-dodecahedral core consisting of a hollow 12-silver-atom icosahedron encapsulated by a 20-silver-atom dodecahedron, and the choice of protective coordinating ligands. The straightforward synthesis of large quantities of pure molecular product promises to make this class of materials widely available for further research and technology development.},

abstract = {The dependence of the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and the electron heat capacity on the electron temperature is investigated for eight representative metals, Al, Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, W, and Ti, for the conditions of strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium. These conditions are characteristic of metal targets subjected to energetic ion bombardment or short-pulse laser irradiation. Computational analysis based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of the electron density of states predicts large deviations (up to an order of magnitude) from the commonly used approximations of linear temperature dependence of the electron heat capacity and a constant electron-phonon coupling. These thermophysical properties are found to be very sensitive to details of the electronic structure of the material. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling can either increase (Al, Au, Ag, Cu, and W), decrease (Ni and Pt), or exhibit nonmonotonic changes (Ti) with increasing electron temperature. The electron heat capacity can exhibit either positive (Au, Ag, Cu, and W) or negative (Ni and Pt) deviations from the linear temperature dependence. The large variations of the thermophysical properties, revealed in this work for the range of electron temperatures typically realized in femtosecond laser material processing applications, have important implications for quantitative computational analysis of ultrafast processes associated with laser interaction with metals.},

Passive and active plasmonic devices provide new pathways to generate, guide, modulate and detect light with structures that are similar in size to state-of-the-art electronic devices.

Secondly, both the donor's and the acceptor's quantum yield of fluorescence can be changed due to the interface-induced enhancement of the radiative emission rate (Purcell effect).

abstract = {The synergy of self- and directed-assembly processes and lithography provides intriguing avenues to fabricate translationally ordered nanoparticle arrangements, but currently lacks the robustness necessary to deliver complex spatial organization. Here, we demonstrate that interparticle spacing and local orientation of gold nanorods (AuNR) can be tuned by controlling the Debye length of AuNR in solution and the dimensions of a chemical contrast pattern. Electrostatic and hydrophobic selectivity for AuNR to absorb to patterned regions of poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) and polystyrene brushes and mats was demonstrated for AuNR functionalized with mercaptopropane sulfonate (MS) and poly(ethylene glycol), respectively. For P2VP patterns of stripes with widths comparable to the length of the AuNR, single- and double-column arrangements of AuNR oriented parallel and perpendicular to the P2VP line were obtained for MS-AuNR. Furthermore, the spacing of the assembled AuNR was uniform along the stripe and related to the ionic strength of the AuNR dispersion. The different AuNR arrangements are consistent with predictions based on maximization of packing of AuNR within the confined strip.},

However, the cost of equipment and the complexity of data analysis have limited the application of FLIM. We present a mathematical model and physical implementation for a low cost digital frequency domain FLIM (DFD-FLIM) system, which can provide lifetime resolution with quality comparable to time-correlated single photon counting methods. Our implementation provides data natively in the form of phasors. On the basis of the mathematical model, we present an error analysis that shows the precise parameters for maximizing the quality of lifetime acquisition, as well as data to support this conclusion. The hardware and software of the proposed DFD-FLIM method simplifies the process of data acquisition for FLIM, presents a new interface for data display and interpretation, and optimizes the accuracy of lifetime determination.},

@article{Hase2010,
abstract = {We present an overview of the feasibility of using coherent phonon spectroscopy to study interaction dynamics of excited lattice vibrations with their environments. By exploiting the features of coherent phonons with a pump-probe technique, one can study lattice motions in a sub-picosecond time range. The dephasing properties tell us not only about interaction dynamics with carriers (electrons and holes) or thermal phonons but also about point defects in crystals. Modulations of the coherent phonon amplitude by more than two modes are closely related to phonon-carrier or phonon-phonon interferences. Related to this phenomenon, formation of coherent phonons at higher harmonics gives direct evidence for phonon-phonon couplings. A combined study of coherent phonons and ultrafast carrier response can be useful for understanding phonon-carrier interaction dynamics. For metals like zinc, nonequilibrium electrons may dominate the dynamics of both relaxation and generation of coherent phonons. The frequency chirp of coherent phonons can be a direct measure of how and when phonon-phonon and phonon-carrier couplings occur. Carbon nanotubes show some complicated behavior due to the existence of many modes with different symmetries, resulting in superposition or interference. To illustrate one of the most interesting applications, the selective excitation of specific phonon modes through the use of a pulse train technique is shown.},

abstract = {Gold nanorods have received much attention due to their unique optical and electronic properties which are dependent on their shape, size, and aspect ratio. This article covers in detail the synthesis, functionalization, self-assembly, and sensing applications of gold nanorods. The synthesis of three major types of rods is discussed: single-crystalline and pentahedrally-twinned rods, which are synthesized by wet chemistry methods, and polycrystalline rods, which are synthesized by templated deposition. Functionalization of these rods is usually necessary for their applications, but can often be problematic due to their surfactant coating. Thus, general strategies are provided for the covalent and noncovalent functionalization of gold nanorods. The review will then examine the significant progress that has been made in controllable assembly of nanorods into various arrangements. This assembly can have a large effect on measurable properties of rods, making it particularly applicable towards sensing of a variety of analytes. Other types of sensing not dependent on nanorod assembly, such as refractive-index based sensing, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Nanoantennas confine electromagnetic fields at visible and infrared wavelengths to volumes of only a few cubic nanometres. Assessing their near-field distribution offers fundamental insight into light-matter coupling and is of special interest for applications such as radiation engineering, attomolar sensing and nonlinear optics. Most experimental approaches to measure near-fields employ either diffraction-limited far-field methods or intricate near-field scanning techniques. Here, using diffraction-unlimited far-field spectroscopy in the infrared, we directly map the intensity of the electric field close to plasmonic nanoantennas. We place a patch of probe molecules with 10 nm accuracy at different locations in the near-field of a resonant antenna and extract the molecular vibrational excitation. We map the field intensity along a dipole antenna and gap-type antennas. Moreover, this method is able to assess the near-field intensity of complex buried plasmonic structures. We demonstrate this by measuring for the first time the near-field intensity of a three-dimensional plasmonic electromagnetically induced transparency structure.},

Site-specific coupling of DNA to proteins allows arrangement of different protein functionalities with emergent properties by self-assembly on origami-like DNA scaffolds or by direct assembly via Single-Molecule Cut {\&} Paste (SMC{\&}P). Here, we employed the ybbR-tag/Sfp system to covalently attach Coenzyme A-modified DNA to GFP and, as a proof of principle, arranged the chimera in different patterns by SMC{\&}P. Fluorescence recordings of individual molecules proved that the proteins remained folded and fully functional throughout the assembly process. The high coupling efficiency and specificity as well as the negligible size (11 amino acids) of the ybbR-tag represent a mild, yet versatile, general and robust way of adding a freely programmable and highly selective attachment site to virtually any protein of interest.},

abstract = {The potential of a single molecular nanoconjugate to intersect all RNA pathways: from gene specific downregulation to silencing the silencers, i.e. siRNA and miRNA pathways, is demonstrated. Gold-nanobeacons are capable of efficiently silencing single gene expression, exogenous siRNA and endogenous miRNAs while yielding a quantifiable fluorescence signal directly proportional to the level of silencing. The silencing potential is comparable to that of traditional siRNA but the same nanoconjugates structure is also capable of reversing the effect of an exogenous siRNA. We further demonstrate the Gold-nanobeacons' efficiency at targeting and silencing miR-21, an endogenous miRNA involved in cancer development, which could become a valid nanotheranostics approach. Again, expression of miR-21 was inhibited with concomitant increase of the Au-nanobeacons' fluorescence that can be used to assess the silencing effect. This way, a single nanostructure can be used to intersect all RNA regulatory pathways while allowing for direct assessment of effective silencing and cell localization via a quantifiable fluorescence signal, making cancer nanotheranostics possible.},

abstract = {Plasmon enhancement of optical properties is both fundamentally important and appealing for many biological and photonic applications. Although metal-enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence has been demonstrated in the solid substrates, there is no report on metal enhanced overall two-photon excitation fluorescence in the colloid system. Here we systematically investigated gold nanorod enhanced one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence of a porphyrin molecule, T790. The separation distance between the metal core and T790 was varied by adjusting the silica shell thickness from 13 to 42 nm. One- and two-photon excitation fluorescence intensities of T790 were found to strongly depend on the thickness of silica shell that separates gold nanorod and T790. The optimum one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement was found to occur at shell thicknesses of 34 and 20 nm, with enhancement factors of 2.1 and 11.8, respectively. Fluorescence lifetime of T790 steadily decreased as the shell thickness decreased. The observed two-photon excitation fluorescence enhancement is ascribed to a combination effect of local electric field amplification and competition between increased radiative and non-radiative decay rates. Core-shell nanoparticles that displayed enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence were also found to exhibit significantly improved singlet oxygen generation capability under two-photon excitation. The applications of these nanoparticles as effective agents for two-photon cell imaging and nano-photosensitizers for two-photon photodynamic therapy with improved efficiency have also been demonstrated in HepG2 cancer cells. The combined advantages of enhanced two-photon excitation fluorescence and two-photon induced singlet oxygen generation make these core-shell nanoparticles as attractive agents for two-photon imaging guided two-photon photodynamic therapy.},

However, the three-dimensional (3D) pathway taken by mRNPs as they transit through the NPC, and the kinetics and selectivity of transport, remain obscure. Here we employ single-molecule fluorescence microscopy with an unprecedented spatiotemporal accuracy of 8 nm and 2 ms to provide new insights into the mechanism of nuclear mRNP export in live human cells. We find that mRNPs exiting the nucleus are decelerated and selected at the centre of the NPC, and adopt a fast-slow-fast diffusion pattern during their brief, {\~{}}12 ms, interaction with the NPC. A 3D reconstruction of the export route indicates that mRNPs primarily interact with the periphery on the nucleoplasmic side and in the centre of the NPC, without entering the central axial conduit utilized for passive diffusion of small molecules, and eventually dissociate on the cytoplasmic side.},

As a proof-of-concept, we print single spherical gold nanoparticles with a positioning precision of 50 nm. By analyzing the printing mechanism, we identify the key physical parameters controlling the method, which has the potential for the production of nanoscale devices and circuits with distinct nanoparticles.},

The microsphere deposited on the target surface generates a nanoscale central lobe illuminating a sub-diffraction-limited cross-section located on the target surface. The SLCM confocal pinhole isolates the reflected light from the near-field subdiffractive cross-section and suppresses the noises from the side lobe and the far-field paraxial focal point. The structural detail of the subdiffractive cross-section is therefore captured, and the 2D target surface near the bottom of microspheres can be imaged by intensity-based point scanning.},

abstract = {A CIS and TD-DFT study using a polarizable continuum solvent model has been conducted to assess non-specific solvent effects on the spectral shifts in Nile Red (NR). The results in this paper show that the electronic band shifts of Nile Red are a consequence of both a field effect on the transition energy and an effect due to a solvent induced geometry change. The S0--{\textgreater}S1 transition experiences a large red-shift with increasing solvent polarity but is relatively insensitive to geometric change. The TD-B3LYP assessment of the S0--{\textgreater}S2 transition yields a blue shift with increasing solvent polarity but a red shift due to the solvent induced geometry change. Ground state dipole moments and polarizabilities are also shown to increase with solvent polarity. CIS optimization of the first excited state of NR is reported, but the solvent effects suggest a locally excited state may have been obtained. Further studies are needed to assess the role of a TICT state.},

abstract = {Acoustic vibrations of single gold nanorods coated with silver were investigated. We used single-particle pump-probe spectroscopy to monitor the silver deposition through the particle vibrations. Two vibration modes, the breathing mode and extensional mode, are observed, and the vibrational frequencies are measured as functions of the amount of silver deposited on single gold nanorods. The breathing mode frequency was found to decrease with silver deposition, while the extensional mode frequency was almost constant for silver shells up to 6 nm. The frequency changes agree with a model based on continuum mechanics and on the assumption of a uniform silver coating. The quality factors for the breathing mode and the extensional mode are hardly affected by silver deposition, indicating that the introduced interface between gold and silver contributes negligibly to the damping of the particle vibrations. Finally, we demonstrated that an atomic layer of silver can be detected using the particle acoustic vibrations.},

abstract = {The following study examines the feasibility of nanoshell-assisted photo-thermal therapy (NAPT). This technique takes advantage of the strong near infrared (NIR) absorption of nanoshells, a new class of gold nanoparticles with tunable optical absorptivities that can undergo passive extravasation from the abnormal tumor vasculature due to their nanoscale size. Tumors were grown in immune-competent mice by subcutaneous injection of murine colon carcinoma cells (CT26.WT). Polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated nanoshells (???130 nm diameter) with peak optical absorption in the NIR were intravenously injected and allowed to circulate for 6 h. Tumors were then illuminated with a diode laser (808 nm, 4W/cm2, 3 min). All such treated tumors abated and treated mice appeared healthy and tumor free {\textgreater}90 days later. Control animals and additional sham-treatment animals (laser treatment without nanoshell injection) were euthanized when tumors grew to a predetermined size, which occurred 6-19 days post-treatment. This simple, non-invasive procedure shows great promise as a technique for selective photo-thermal tumor ablation. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We have developed a technique using a photothermal microscope from which we can make a thermal image of an electronic component working at a ‘‘high frequency'' using a charge coupled device (CCD) camera and a multichannel lock-in scheme. To do this, we have created an electronic ‘‘stroboscope'': the frequency F of the thermal signal induced by a high frequency electrical excitation and the frequency of the light F+f that illuminates the device are next to each other; the signal reflected at the surface of the device whose amplitude is proportional to the variation of reflectivity and hence to the variation of temperature and whose frequency is the blinking one f is analyzed by a visible CCD camera. Amplitude and phase images of the high frequency thermal phenomenon can then be made. Moreover, this technique presents a great advantage: the spatial resolution is better than 1m. The amplitude and phase images presented show, with a very good spatial resolution, Joule and Peltier heating of a polycrystalline silicon 2.5 k resistor across which a sinusoidal current is forced.},

Moreover, emission properties detected at the optical far field are dictated by the antenna. Here we study the emission from molecule−antenna hybrids by means of super- resolution localization and defocused imaging. Whereas gold nanorods make single-crystal violet molecules in the tip's vicinity visible in fluorescence, super-resolution localization on the enhanced molecular fluorescence reveals geometrical centers of the nanorod antenna instead. Furthermore, emission angular distributions of dyes linked to the nanorod surface resemble that of nanorods in defocused imaging. The experimental observations are consistent with numerical calculations using the finite-difference time-domain method.},

abstract = {A CIS and TD-DFT study using a polarizable continuum solvent model has been conducted to assess non-specific solvent effects on the spectral shifts in Nile Red (NR). The results in this paper show that the electronic band shifts of Nile Red are a consequence of both a field effect on the transition energy and an effect due to a solvent induced geometry change. The S0--{\textgreater}S1 transition experiences a large red-shift with increasing solvent polarity but is relatively insensitive to geometric change. The TD-B3LYP assessment of the S0--{\textgreater}S2 transition yields a blue shift with increasing solvent polarity but a red shift due to the solvent induced geometry change. Ground state dipole moments and polarizabilities are also shown to increase with solvent polarity. CIS optimization of the first excited state of NR is reported, but the solvent effects suggest a locally excited state may have been obtained. Further studies are needed to assess the role of a TICT state.},

@article{Takei2014,
abstract = {The homeostasis of body temperature and energy balance is one of the major principles in biology. Nanoscale thermometry of aqueous solutions is a challenging but crucial technique to understand the molecular basis of this essential process. Here, we developed a ratiometric nanothermometer (RNT) for intracellular temperature measurement in real time. Both the thermosensitive fluorophore, $\beta$-diketonate chelate europium(III) thenoyltrifluoroacetonate, and the thermoinsensitive fluorophore, rhodamine 101, which was used as a self-reference, are embedded in a polymeric particle that protects the fluorophores from intracellular conditions. The ratiometric measurement of single RNT spots is independent of the displacement of the RNT along the z-axis. The temperature is therefore determined at the location of each RNT under an optical microscope regardless of the dynamic movement of living cells. As a demonstration of the spot-by-spot intracellular thermometry, we successfully followed the temperature change in individual RNT spots in a single cell together with the Ca(2+) burst induced by the Ca(2+) ionophore ionomycin. The temperature increases differently among different spots, implying heterogeneous heat production in the cell. We then show that, in some spots, the temperature gradually decreases, while in others it remains high. The average temperature elevation within a cell is positively correlated to the increase in Ca(2+), suggesting that the activity and/or number of heat sources are dependent on the Ca(2+) concentration.},

@article{Li2013b,
abstract = {Using the random phase approximation with both real space and discrete electron–hole (e–h) pair basis sets, we study the broadening of surface plasmons in metal structures of reduced dimensionality, where Landau damping is the dominant dissipation channel and presents an intrinsic limitation to plasmonics technology. We show that for every prototypical class of systems considered, including zero-dimensional nanoshells, one-dimensional coaxial nanotubes and two-dimensional ultrathin films, Landau damping can be drastically tuned due to energy quantization of the individual electron levels and e–h pairs. Both the generic trend and oscillatory nature of the tunability are in stark contrast with the expectations of the semiclassical surface scattering picture. Our approach also allows to vividly depict the evolution of the plasmons from the quantum to the classical regime, and to elucidate the underlying physical origin of hybridization broadening of nearly degenerate plasmon modes. These findings may serve as a guide in the future design of plasmonic nanostructures of desirable functionalities.},

@article{Baffou2009,
abstract = {We report on a thermal imaging technique based on fluorescence polarization anisotropy measurements, which enables mapping the local temperature near nanometer-sized heat sources with 300 nm spatial resolution and a typical accuracy of 0.1 degrees C. The principle is demonstrated by mapping the temperature landscape around plasmonic nano-structures heated by near-infrared light. By assessing directly the molecules' Brownian dynamics, it is shown that fluorescence polarization anisotropy is a robust and reliable method which overcomes the limitations of previous thermal imaging techniques. It opens new perspectives in medicine, nanoelectronics and nanofluidics where a control of temperature of a few degrees at the nanoscale is required.},
